train_hindifullfemale_00001| Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc. 
train_hindifullfemale_00002| Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore. 
train_hindifullfemale_00003| For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_00004| Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil. 
train_hindifullfemale_00005| Will we ever forget it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00006| God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever. 
train_hindifullfemale_00007| And you always want to see it in the superlative degree. 
train_hindifullfemale_00008| Gad, your letter came just in time. 
train_hindifullfemale_00009| He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table. 
train_hindifullfemale_00010| I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game. 
train_hindifullfemale_00011| If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now. 
train_hindifullfemale_00012| Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet. 
train_hindifullfemale_00013| He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique. 
train_hindifullfemale_00014| Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00015| It is the aurora borealis. 
train_hindifullfemale_00016| There's Fort Churchill, a rifle shot beyond the ridge, asleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_00017| From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00018| There was a change now. 
train_hindifullfemale_00019| I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances. 
train_hindifullfemale_00020| Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories. 
train_hindifullfemale_00021| It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00022| Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition. 
train_hindifullfemale_00023| A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges. 
train_hindifullfemale_00024| It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00025| I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00026| It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting. 
train_hindifullfemale_00027| To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor. 
train_hindifullfemale_00028| Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
train_hindifullfemale_00029| Their forces were already moving into the north country. 
train_hindifullfemale_00030| I had faith in them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00031| They were three hundred yards apart. 
train_hindifullfemale_00032| Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step. 
train_hindifullfemale_00033| He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson. 
train_hindifullfemale_00034| Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children. 
train_hindifullfemale_00035| He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_00036| She turned in at the hotel. 
train_hindifullfemale_00037| I was the only one who remained sitting. 
train_hindifullfemale_00038| We'll have to watch our chances. 
train_hindifullfemale_00039| The ship should be in within a week or ten days. 
train_hindifullfemale_00040| I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here. 
train_hindifullfemale_00041| Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell. 
train_hindifullfemale_00042| How could he explain his possession of the sketch. 
train_hindifullfemale_00043| It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson. 
train_hindifullfemale_00044| Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip. 
train_hindifullfemale_00045| He moved away as quietly as he had come. 
train_hindifullfemale_00046| The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_00047| Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf dog. 
train_hindifullfemale_00048| He looked at the handkerchief more, closely. 
train_hindifullfemale_00049| Gregson was asleep when he re entered the cabin. 
train_hindifullfemale_00050| In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously. 
train_hindifullfemale_00051| The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow. 
train_hindifullfemale_00052| It was a curious coincidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_00053| Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief. 
train_hindifullfemale_00054| There was nothing on the rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_00055| Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound. 
train_hindifullfemale_00056| Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00057| I have no idea, replied Philip. 
train_hindifullfemale_00058| I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else. 
train_hindifullfemale_00059| His immaculate appearance was gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_00060| Anyway, no one saw her like that. 
train_hindifullfemale_00061| Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00062| The men stared into each other's face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00063| Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger. 
train_hindifullfemale_00064| The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments. 
train_hindifullfemale_00065| They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel. 
train_hindifullfemale_00066| He saw Jeanne falter for a moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00067| Surely I will excuse you, she cried. 
train_hindifullfemale_00068| In a flash Philip followed its direction. 
train_hindifullfemale_00069| It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father. 
train_hindifullfemale_00070| He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there. 
train_hindifullfemale_00071| What was the object of your little sensation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00072| But who was Eileen's double. 
train_hindifullfemale_00073| The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00074| And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00075| There has been a change, she interrupted him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00076| The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened. 
train_hindifullfemale_00077| It is the fire, partly, she said. 
train_hindifullfemale_00078| Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her. 
train_hindifullfemale_00079| It was a large canoe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00080| What if Jeanne failed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00081| What if she did not come to the rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_00082| His face was streaming with blood. 
train_hindifullfemale_00083| A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_00084| Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open. 
train_hindifullfemale_00085| A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00086| Death had come with terrible suddenness. 
train_hindifullfemale_00087| Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man. 
train_hindifullfemale_00088| He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling. 
train_hindifullfemale_00089| The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by. 
train_hindifullfemale_00090| The singing voice approached rapidly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00091| His blood grew hot with rage at the thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_00092| He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores. 
train_hindifullfemale_00093| For a full minute he crouched and listened. 
train_hindifullfemale_00094| He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_00095| A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision. 
train_hindifullfemale_00096| Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_00097| Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow. 
train_hindifullfemale_00098| Shall I carry you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00099| A maddening joy pounded in his brain. 
train_hindifullfemale_00100| You must sleep, he urged. 
train_hindifullfemale_00101| You, you would not keep the truth from me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00102| He will follow us soon. 
train_hindifullfemale_00103| But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00104| She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child. 
train_hindifullfemale_00105| Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00106| The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob. 
train_hindifullfemale_00107| If you only could know how I thank you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00108| He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_00109| Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00110| Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely. 
train_hindifullfemale_00111| Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children. 
train_hindifullfemale_00112| He was wounded in the arm. 
train_hindifullfemale_00113| I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians. 
train_hindifullfemale_00114| Her words sent a strange chill through Philip. 
train_hindifullfemale_00115| He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00116| Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin. 
train_hindifullfemale_00117| She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_00118| Pierre obeys me when we are together. 
train_hindifullfemale_00119| Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward. 
train_hindifullfemale_00120| My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante. 
train_hindifullfemale_00121| They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours. 
train_hindifullfemale_00122| Two years ago I gave up civilization for this. 
train_hindifullfemale_00123| She had died from cold and starvation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00124| It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks. 
train_hindifullfemale_00125| He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_00126| Each day she became a more vital part of him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00127| It was a temptation, but he resisted it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00128| This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born. 
train_hindifullfemale_00129| Her face was against his breast. 
train_hindifullfemale_00130| She was his now, forever. 
train_hindifullfemale_00131| Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom. 
train_hindifullfemale_00132| A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips. 
train_hindifullfemale_00133| Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength. 
train_hindifullfemale_00134| He obeyed the pressure of her hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_00135| I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre. 
train_hindifullfemale_00136| About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age. 
train_hindifullfemale_00137| Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_00138| In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne. 
train_hindifullfemale_00139| He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes. 
train_hindifullfemale_00140| Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this. 
train_hindifullfemale_00141| It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God. 
train_hindifullfemale_00142| Such things had occurred before, he told Philip. 
train_hindifullfemale_00143| Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00144| But there was something even more startling than this resemblance. 
train_hindifullfemale_00145| I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily. 
train_hindifullfemale_00146| Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued. 
train_hindifullfemale_00147| A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness. 
train_hindifullfemale_00148| Now these things had been struck dead within him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00149| For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky. 
train_hindifullfemale_00150| Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted. 
train_hindifullfemale_00151| And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare. 
train_hindifullfemale_00152| Philip thrust himself against it and entered. 
train_hindifullfemale_00153| MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger. 
train_hindifullfemale_00154| He was smooth shaven, and his hair and eyes were black. 
train_hindifullfemale_00155| Won't you draw up, gentlemen. 
train_hindifullfemale_00156| A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned. 
train_hindifullfemale_00157| He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice. 
train_hindifullfemale_00158| Does that look good. 
train_hindifullfemale_00159| They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life. 
train_hindifullfemale_00160| You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt. 
train_hindifullfemale_00161| Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub. 
train_hindifullfemale_00162| That's the sub foreman, explained Thorpe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00163| Philip made no effort to follow. 
train_hindifullfemale_00164| He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne. 
train_hindifullfemale_00165| They are to attack your camp tomorrow night. 
train_hindifullfemale_00166| Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding. 
train_hindifullfemale_00167| I was near the cabin, and saw you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00168| Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting. 
train_hindifullfemale_00169| Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant. 
train_hindifullfemale_00170| There was none of the joy of meeting in his face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00171| And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen. 
train_hindifullfemale_00172| Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar. 
train_hindifullfemale_00173| The date was nearly eighteen years old. 
train_hindifullfemale_00174| They were the presage of storm. 
train_hindifullfemale_00175| Down there the earth was already swelling with life. 
train_hindifullfemale_00176| For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap. 
train_hindifullfemale_00177| She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled. 
train_hindifullfemale_00178| Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated. 
train_hindifullfemale_00179| Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said. 
train_hindifullfemale_00180| If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00181| So cheer up, and give us your paw. 
train_hindifullfemale_00182| This time he did not yap for mercy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00183| And the air was growing chilly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00184| Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two. 
train_hindifullfemale_00185| The questions may have come vaguely in his mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_00186| Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl. 
train_hindifullfemale_00187| Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine. 
train_hindifullfemale_00188| The big eyed, clucking moose birds were most annoying. 
train_hindifullfemale_00189| Next to them the Canada jays were more persistent. 
train_hindifullfemale_00190| For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_00191| He did not rush in. 
train_hindifullfemale_00192| It was edged with ice. 
train_hindifullfemale_00193| He drank of the water cautiously. 
train_hindifullfemale_00194| But a strange thing happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_00195| He began to follow the footprints of the dog. 
train_hindifullfemale_00196| Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose. 
train_hindifullfemale_00197| Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions. 
train_hindifullfemale_00198| Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day. 
train_hindifullfemale_00199| He leapt again, and the club caught him once more. 
train_hindifullfemale_00200| He cried, and swung the club wildly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00201| She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00202| They were following the shore of a lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_00203| The wolf dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00204| From now on we're pals. 
train_hindifullfemale_00205| He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau. 
train_hindifullfemale_00206| How much was it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00207| Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression. 
train_hindifullfemale_00208| It was not a large lake, and almost round. 
train_hindifullfemale_00209| Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards. 
train_hindifullfemale_00210| It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made. 
train_hindifullfemale_00211| Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman. 
train_hindifullfemale_00212| Between him and the beach was the cane grass fence of the compound. 
train_hindifullfemale_00213| Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head. 
train_hindifullfemale_00214| They die out of spite. 
train_hindifullfemale_00215| The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00216| Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive. 
train_hindifullfemale_00217| The ringing of the big bell aroused him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00218| At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_00219| A dead man is of no use on a plantation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00220| I don't know why you're here at all. 
train_hindifullfemale_00221| What part of the United States is your home. 
train_hindifullfemale_00222| My, I'm almost homesick for it already. 
train_hindifullfemale_00223| She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist. 
train_hindifullfemale_00224| I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up. 
train_hindifullfemale_00225| That came before my A B C's. 
train_hindifullfemale_00226| It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles. 
train_hindifullfemale_00227| But it contributed to the smash. 
train_hindifullfemale_00228| The last one I knew was an overseer. 
train_hindifullfemale_00229| Do you know any good land around here. 
train_hindifullfemale_00230| The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia. 
train_hindifullfemale_00231| I cannot follow you, she said. 
train_hindifullfemale_00232| I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00233| Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil. 
train_hindifullfemale_00234| His voice was passionately rebellious. 
train_hindifullfemale_00235| Don't you see I hate you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00236| So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00237| It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon. 
train_hindifullfemale_00238| He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter. 
train_hindifullfemale_00239| Wash your hands of me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00240| I think it's much nicer to quarrel. 
train_hindifullfemale_00241| I saw it when she rolled. 
train_hindifullfemale_00242| I only read the quotations. 
train_hindifullfemale_00243| He was the soul of devotion to his employers. 
train_hindifullfemale_00244| Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year. 
train_hindifullfemale_00245| You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi. 
train_hindifullfemale_00246| They ought to pass here some time today. 
train_hindifullfemale_00247| I had been sad too long already. 
train_hindifullfemale_00248| All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00249| He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition. 
train_hindifullfemale_00250| I may manage to freight a cargo back as well. 
train_hindifullfemale_00251| O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals. 
train_hindifullfemale_00252| He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino. 
train_hindifullfemale_00253| Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller. 
train_hindifullfemale_00254| You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that. 
train_hindifullfemale_00255| See the length of the body and that elongated neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_00256| They are coming ashore, whoever they are. 
train_hindifullfemale_00257| Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays. 
train_hindifullfemale_00258| Think of investing in such an adventure. 
train_hindifullfemale_00259| Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all. 
train_hindifullfemale_00260| I have been doubly baptized. 
train_hindifullfemale_00261| They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha. 
train_hindifullfemale_00262| Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00263| And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young. 
train_hindifullfemale_00264| The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00265| They handled two men already, both grub thieves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00266| Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow. 
train_hindifullfemale_00267| Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_00268| That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_00269| And after the bath a shave would not be bad. 
train_hindifullfemale_00270| Now please give a plain statement of what occurred. 
train_hindifullfemale_00271| You can take a vacation on pay. 
train_hindifullfemale_00272| They are big trees and require plenty of room. 
train_hindifullfemale_00273| And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_00274| There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00275| Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference. 
train_hindifullfemale_00276| McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin. 
train_hindifullfemale_00277| It would give me nervous prostration. 
train_hindifullfemale_00278| She said with chattering teeth. 
train_hindifullfemale_00279| I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes. 
train_hindifullfemale_00280| I do not blame you for anything; remember that. 
train_hindifullfemale_00281| If you mean to insinuate Brentwood began hotly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00282| The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant. 
train_hindifullfemale_00283| There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes. 
train_hindifullfemale_00284| But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine. 
train_hindifullfemale_00285| Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping. 
train_hindifullfemale_00286| Keep an eye on him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00287| Those are my oysters, he said at last. 
train_hindifullfemale_00288| They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued. 
train_hindifullfemale_00289| One by one the boys were captured. 
train_hindifullfemale_00290| The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted. 
train_hindifullfemale_00291| Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred. 
train_hindifullfemale_00292| They were deep in the primeval forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_00293| He had been foiled in his attempt to escape. 
train_hindifullfemale_00294| And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows. 
train_hindifullfemale_00295| Bassett was a fastidious man. 
train_hindifullfemale_00296| There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts. 
train_hindifullfemale_00297| This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy thrill. 
train_hindifullfemale_00298| I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot. 
train_hindifullfemale_00299| From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror. 
train_hindifullfemale_00300| But all my dreams violated this law. 
train_hindifullfemale_00301| It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis. 
train_hindifullfemale_00302| But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality. 
train_hindifullfemale_00303| I graduated last of my class. 
train_hindifullfemale_00304| They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs. 
train_hindifullfemale_00305| He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary. 
train_hindifullfemale_00306| Very early in my life, I separated from my mother. 
train_hindifullfemale_00307| His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00308| White Leghorns, said missus Mortimer. 
train_hindifullfemale_00309| Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply. 
train_hindifullfemale_00310| Therefore, hurrah for the game. 
train_hindifullfemale_00311| It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass. 
train_hindifullfemale_00312| Broken Tooth yelled with fright and pain. 
train_hindifullfemale_00313| Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World. 
train_hindifullfemale_00314| Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00315| We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once. 
train_hindifullfemale_00316| He was a wise hyena. 
train_hindifullfemale_00317| Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself. 
train_hindifullfemale_00318| And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom. 
train_hindifullfemale_00319| With my strength I slammed it full into Red Eye's face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00320| The log on which Lop Ear was lying got adrift. 
train_hindifullfemale_00321| This is a common experience with all of us. 
train_hindifullfemale_00322| He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat. 
train_hindifullfemale_00323| It was not Red Eye's way to forego revenge so easily. 
train_hindifullfemale_00324| Whiz zip bang. Lop Ear screamed with sudden anguish. 
train_hindifullfemale_00325| Cherokee identified himself with his instinct. 
train_hindifullfemale_00326| They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements. 
train_hindifullfemale_00327| The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00328| Ah, indeed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00329| Red Eye never committed a more outrageous deed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00330| Poor little Crooked Leg was terribly scared. 
train_hindifullfemale_00331| Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm. 
train_hindifullfemale_00332| This is no place for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00333| He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time. 
train_hindifullfemale_00334| Red Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down. 
train_hindifullfemale_00335| So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet. 
train_hindifullfemale_00336| Encouraged by my conduct, Big Face became a sudden ally. 
train_hindifullfemale_00337| The fighting had now become intermittent. 
train_hindifullfemale_00338| They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands. 
train_hindifullfemale_00339| It was like the beating of hoofs. 
train_hindifullfemale_00340| Why, doggone you all, shake again. 
train_hindifullfemale_00341| Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago. 
train_hindifullfemale_00342| You mean for this State, General, Alberta. 
train_hindifullfemale_00343| He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality. 
train_hindifullfemale_00344| She was trying to pass the apron string around him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00345| Get down and dig in. 
train_hindifullfemale_00346| They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound. 
train_hindifullfemale_00347| They only lifted seven hundred and fifty. 
train_hindifullfemale_00348| It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his. 
train_hindifullfemale_00349| Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing. 
train_hindifullfemale_00350| It was more like sugar. 
train_hindifullfemale_00351| I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah. 
train_hindifullfemale_00352| Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out. 
train_hindifullfemale_00353| Fresh meat they failed to obtain. 
train_hindifullfemale_00354| A burst of laughter was his reward. 
train_hindifullfemale_00355| You don't catch me at any such foolishness. 
train_hindifullfemale_00356| A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet. 
train_hindifullfemale_00357| They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00358| Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan. 
train_hindifullfemale_00359| But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion. 
train_hindifullfemale_00360| But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully. 
train_hindifullfemale_00361| Nope, not the slightest idea. 
train_hindifullfemale_00362| It is not an attempt to smash the market. 
train_hindifullfemale_00363| We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more. 
train_hindifullfemale_00364| These rumors may even originate with us. 
train_hindifullfemale_00365| A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth. 
train_hindifullfemale_00366| There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not. 
train_hindifullfemale_00367| I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings. 
train_hindifullfemale_00368| In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban. 
train_hindifullfemale_00369| He saw all men in the business game doing this. 
train_hindifullfemale_00370| It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal. 
train_hindifullfemale_00371| He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way. 
train_hindifullfemale_00372| Points of view, new ideas, life. 
train_hindifullfemale_00373| But life's worth more than cash, she argued. 
train_hindifullfemale_00374| The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants. 
train_hindifullfemale_00375| Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week. 
train_hindifullfemale_00376| This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place. 
train_hindifullfemale_00377| That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged. 
train_hindifullfemale_00378| How old are you, daddy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00379| But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth. 
train_hindifullfemale_00380| My name's Ferguson. 
train_hindifullfemale_00381| Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man. 
train_hindifullfemale_00382| To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising. 
train_hindifullfemale_00383| The farmer works the soil and produces grain. 
train_hindifullfemale_00384| That's what Carnegie did. 
train_hindifullfemale_00385| I can't argue with you, and you know that. 
train_hindifullfemale_00386| Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab. 
train_hindifullfemale_00387| It was my idea to a tee. 
train_hindifullfemale_00388| Mab, she said. 
train_hindifullfemale_00389| I'll go over tomorrow afternoon. 
train_hindifullfemale_00390| But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith. 
train_hindifullfemale_00391| There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable. 
train_hindifullfemale_00392| Already he had begun borrowing from the banks. 
train_hindifullfemale_00393| It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under. 
train_hindifullfemale_00394| As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily. 
train_hindifullfemale_00395| A rising tide of fat had submerged them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00396| Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically. 
train_hindifullfemale_00397| In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur. 
train_hindifullfemale_00398| And here's another idea. 
train_hindifullfemale_00399| Manuel had one besetting sin. 
train_hindifullfemale_00400| The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club. 
train_hindifullfemale_00401| Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside. 
train_hindifullfemale_00402| His newborn cunning gave him poise and control. 
train_hindifullfemale_00403| Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box. 
train_hindifullfemale_00404| It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work. 
train_hindifullfemale_00405| And that was the last of Francois and Perrault. 
train_hindifullfemale_00406| Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria. 
train_hindifullfemale_00407| The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test. 
train_hindifullfemale_00408| He could feel a new stir in the land. 
train_hindifullfemale_00409| So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well. 
train_hindifullfemale_00410| It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_00411| There is another virtue in these bulkheads. 
train_hindifullfemale_00412| But I am at the end of my resources. 
train_hindifullfemale_00413| Now our figuring was all right. 
train_hindifullfemale_00414| It lasted as a deterrent for two days. 
train_hindifullfemale_00415| The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour. 
train_hindifullfemale_00416| It is also an insidious, deceitful sun. 
train_hindifullfemale_00417| The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer. 
train_hindifullfemale_00418| The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian. 
train_hindifullfemale_00419| When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically. 
train_hindifullfemale_00420| By golly, the boy wins. 
train_hindifullfemale_00421| Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider. 
train_hindifullfemale_00422| McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu. 
train_hindifullfemale_00423| Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact. 
train_hindifullfemale_00424| Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring. 
train_hindifullfemale_00425| They do not know the length of time of incubation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00426| Enters now the psychology of the situation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00427| It was not exactly a deportation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00428| Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence. 
train_hindifullfemale_00429| Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance. 
train_hindifullfemale_00430| Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk. 
train_hindifullfemale_00431| The boy at the wheel lost his head. 
train_hindifullfemale_00432| To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo. 
train_hindifullfemale_00433| A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds. 
train_hindifullfemale_00434| What do you mean by this outrageous conduct. 
train_hindifullfemale_00435| But Martin smiled a superior smile. 
train_hindifullfemale_00436| By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell. 
train_hindifullfemale_00437| At sea, Monday, March sixteen, nineteen hundred and eight. 
train_hindifullfemale_00438| At sea, Wednesday, March eighteenth, nineteen hundred and eight. 
train_hindifullfemale_00439| Yes, sir, I corrected. 
train_hindifullfemale_00440| Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00441| You live on an income which is your father earned. 
train_hindifullfemale_00442| He was worth nothing to the world. 
train_hindifullfemale_00443| Then you don't believe in altruism. 
train_hindifullfemale_00444| The creative joy, I murmured. 
train_hindifullfemale_00445| He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument. 
train_hindifullfemale_00446| Ah, it is growing dark and darker. 
train_hindifullfemale_00447| I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost. 
train_hindifullfemale_00448| A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail. 
train_hindifullfemale_00449| No man ate of the seal meat or the oil. 
train_hindifullfemale_00450| I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_00451| Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting. 
train_hindifullfemale_00452| Eighteen hundred, he calculated. 
train_hindifullfemale_00453| The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00454| I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00455| But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_00456| What I saw I could not at first believe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00457| The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell. 
train_hindifullfemale_00458| There's too much of the schoolboy in me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00459| I had forgotten their existence. 
train_hindifullfemale_00460| Ah, we were very close together in that moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00461| But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind. 
train_hindifullfemale_00462| They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate. 
train_hindifullfemale_00463| Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_00464| He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage. 
train_hindifullfemale_00465| Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human. 
train_hindifullfemale_00466| And so early in the voyage, too. 
train_hindifullfemale_00467| In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius. 
train_hindifullfemale_00468| The eastern heavens were equally spectacular. 
train_hindifullfemale_00469| He spat it out like so much venom. 
train_hindifullfemale_00470| I saw mister Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically. 
train_hindifullfemale_00471| He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure. 
train_hindifullfemale_00472| The night was calm and snowy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00473| I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born. 
train_hindifullfemale_00474| His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused. 
train_hindifullfemale_00475| At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder. 
train_hindifullfemale_00476| Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00477| Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after room. 
train_hindifullfemale_00478| I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored. 
train_hindifullfemale_00479| Tom Spink has a harpoon. 
train_hindifullfemale_00480| Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness. 
train_hindifullfemale_00481| And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out. 
train_hindifullfemale_00482| Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes. 
train_hindifullfemale_00483| No sir ee. 
train_hindifullfemale_00484| Each insult added to the value of the claim. 
train_hindifullfemale_00485| For the rest, he was a mere automaton. 
train_hindifullfemale_00486| The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness. 
train_hindifullfemale_00487| Their love burned with increasing brightness. 
train_hindifullfemale_00488| They were artists, not biologists. 
train_hindifullfemale_00489| Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked. 
train_hindifullfemale_00490| And as in denial of guilt, the one legged boy replied. 
train_hindifullfemale_00491| Burnt out like the crater of a volcano. 
train_hindifullfemale_00492| The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated. 
train_hindifullfemale_00493| O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm. 
train_hindifullfemale_00494| He bore no grudges and had few enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_00495| And Tom King patiently endured. 
train_hindifullfemale_00496| King took every advantage he knew. 
train_hindifullfemale_00497| The lines were now very taut. 
train_hindifullfemale_00498| And right there I saw and knew it all. 
train_hindifullfemale_00499| Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury. 
train_hindifullfemale_00500| You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate. 
train_hindifullfemale_00501| Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai. 
train_hindifullfemale_00502| His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00503| He was an athlete and a giant. 
train_hindifullfemale_00504| We fished sharks on Niihau together. 
train_hindifullfemale_00505| The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu. 
train_hindifullfemale_00506| In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics. 
train_hindifullfemale_00507| Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity. 
train_hindifullfemale_00508| Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked. 
train_hindifullfemale_00509| Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00510| There is more behind this than a mere university ideal. 
train_hindifullfemale_00511| No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_00512| We must give ourselves and not our money alone. 
train_hindifullfemale_00513| We are consumed in our own flesh pots. 
train_hindifullfemale_00514| But here amongst ourselves let us speak out. 
train_hindifullfemale_00515| Also, there was awe in their faces. 
train_hindifullfemale_00516| Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00517| Illuminating oil was becoming all profit. 
train_hindifullfemale_00518| Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land. 
train_hindifullfemale_00519| He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem. 
train_hindifullfemale_00520| Without them he could not run his empire. 
train_hindifullfemale_00521| For such countries nothing remained but reorganization. 
train_hindifullfemale_00522| They could not continue their method of producing surpluses. 
train_hindifullfemale_00523| At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states. 
train_hindifullfemale_00524| The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work. 
train_hindifullfemale_00525| Nowhere did the raw earth appear. 
train_hindifullfemale_00526| The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield. 
train_hindifullfemale_00527| Men who endure it, call it living death. 
train_hindifullfemale_00528| As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00529| Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini. 
train_hindifullfemale_00530| In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining. 
train_hindifullfemale_00531| May drought destroy your crops. 
train_hindifullfemale_00532| Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse. 
train_hindifullfemale_00533| But Johannes could, and did. 
train_hindifullfemale_00534| A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem. 
train_hindifullfemale_00535| He would destroy all things that are fixed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00536| He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller. 
train_hindifullfemale_00537| What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived. 
train_hindifullfemale_00538| I should like to engage just for one whole life in that. 
train_hindifullfemale_00539| Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean. 
train_hindifullfemale_00540| The Warden with a quart of champagne. 
train_hindifullfemale_00541| Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements. 
train_hindifullfemale_00542| I had been born with no organic chemical predisposition towards alcohol. 
train_hindifullfemale_00543| He may anticipate the day of his death. 
train_hindifullfemale_00544| The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00545| I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze. 
train_hindifullfemale_00546| Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk. 
train_hindifullfemale_00547| Also, churches and preachers I had never known. 
train_hindifullfemale_00548| This also became part of the daily schedule. 
train_hindifullfemale_00549| All an appearance can know is mirage. 
train_hindifullfemale_00550| Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00551| I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii. 
train_hindifullfemale_00552| Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu. 
train_hindifullfemale_00553| Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away. 
train_hindifullfemale_00554| Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already. 
train_hindifullfemale_00555| The last refugee had passed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00556| And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience. 
train_hindifullfemale_00557| Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_00558| His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips. 
train_hindifullfemale_00559| Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00560| What the flaming. 
train_hindifullfemale_00561| missus McFee's jaws brought together with a snap. 
train_hindifullfemale_00562| Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality. 
train_hindifullfemale_00563| With them were Indians, also three other men. 
train_hindifullfemale_00564| Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document. 
train_hindifullfemale_00565| Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet. 
train_hindifullfemale_00566| He was just bursting with joy, joy over what. 
train_hindifullfemale_00567| At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00568| Behind him lay the thousand years long road across all Siberia and Russia. 
train_hindifullfemale_00569| He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out. 
train_hindifullfemale_00570| I never saw anything like her in my life. 
train_hindifullfemale_00571| There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00572| Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying. 
train_hindifullfemale_00573| There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know. 
train_hindifullfemale_00574| And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers. 
train_hindifullfemale_00575| Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless. 
train_hindifullfemale_00576| But we'll just postpone this. 
train_hindifullfemale_00577| There was the Emma Louisa. 
train_hindifullfemale_00578| This is my fifth voyage. 
train_hindifullfemale_00579| It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_00580| Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along. 
train_hindifullfemale_00581| Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake. 
train_hindifullfemale_00582| I have long noted your thirst unquenchable. 
train_hindifullfemale_00583| Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested. 
train_hindifullfemale_00584| We don't see ourselves as foolish. 
train_hindifullfemale_00585| He had comparatively no advantages at first. 
train_hindifullfemale_00586| He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions. 
train_hindifullfemale_00587| I was sick once typhoid. 
train_hindifullfemale_00588| In a way he is my protege. 
train_hindifullfemale_00589| We are both children together. 
train_hindifullfemale_00590| It's only his indigestion I find fault with. 
train_hindifullfemale_00591| She'd make a good wife for the cashier. 
train_hindifullfemale_00592| Gad, do I remember it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00593| You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl. 
train_hindifullfemale_00594| I can see that knife now. 
train_hindifullfemale_00595| When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die. 
train_hindifullfemale_00596| His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's. 
train_hindifullfemale_00597| He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door. 
train_hindifullfemale_00598| Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill. 
train_hindifullfemale_00599| Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile. 
train_hindifullfemale_00600| I'd say there was going to be glorious scrap. 
train_hindifullfemale_00601| He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger. 
train_hindifullfemale_00602| His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00603| Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00604| Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00605| Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout. 
train_hindifullfemale_00606| They robbed me a few years later. 
train_hindifullfemale_00607| He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00608| Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected. 
train_hindifullfemale_00609| I was completely lost in my work. 
train_hindifullfemale_00610| His slim hands gripped the edges of the table. 
train_hindifullfemale_00611| He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue. 
train_hindifullfemale_00612| Philip dropped back into his chair. 
train_hindifullfemale_00613| If I was out of the game it would be easily made. 
train_hindifullfemale_00614| MacDougall, my engineer, believes it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00615| It is growing, every day, every hour. 
train_hindifullfemale_00616| Now, you understand. 
train_hindifullfemale_00617| You have associated with some of these men. 
train_hindifullfemale_00618| And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight. 
train_hindifullfemale_00619| Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00620| All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto. 
train_hindifullfemale_00621| Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips. 
train_hindifullfemale_00622| Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil. 
train_hindifullfemale_00623| He caught himself with a jerk. 
train_hindifullfemale_00624| How does your wager look now. 
train_hindifullfemale_00625| He confessed that the sketch had startled him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00626| After all, the picture was only a resemblance. 
train_hindifullfemale_00627| He wondered, too, where Roscoe was. 
train_hindifullfemale_00628| Philip knew that she was not an Indian. 
train_hindifullfemale_00629| In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things. 
train_hindifullfemale_00630| Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00631| The thought set his blood tingling. 
train_hindifullfemale_00632| But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_00633| Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief. 
train_hindifullfemale_00634| It won't be for sale. 
train_hindifullfemale_00635| For a few moments he ate in silence. 
train_hindifullfemale_00636| Philip did not pursue the subject. 
train_hindifullfemale_00637| Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00638| Suppose you saw me at work through the window. 
train_hindifullfemale_00639| He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two. 
train_hindifullfemale_00640| There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words. 
train_hindifullfemale_00641| All this day Gregson remained in the cabin. 
train_hindifullfemale_00642| The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson. 
train_hindifullfemale_00643| The flush was gone from her face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00644| That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00645| He understood the meaning of the look. 
train_hindifullfemale_00646| She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before. 
train_hindifullfemale_00647| I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson. 
train_hindifullfemale_00648| They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers. 
train_hindifullfemale_00649| We must achieve our own salvation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00650| In moments of mental energy Philip was restless. 
train_hindifullfemale_00651| He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two. 
train_hindifullfemale_00652| Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence. 
train_hindifullfemale_00653| Now it was missing from the wall. 
train_hindifullfemale_00654| He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait. 
train_hindifullfemale_00655| I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight. 
train_hindifullfemale_00656| Now have you got anything to say against me, mister Philip. 
train_hindifullfemale_00657| If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen. 
train_hindifullfemale_00658| Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight. 
train_hindifullfemale_00659| Only the chance sound had led him to observe them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00660| Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre. 
train_hindifullfemale_00661| There was no chance to fire without hitting him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00662| There was no answer from the other side. 
train_hindifullfemale_00663| Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00664| With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone. 
train_hindifullfemale_00665| Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive. 
train_hindifullfemale_00666| In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution. 
train_hindifullfemale_00667| Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00668| It is the nearest refuge. 
train_hindifullfemale_00669| There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_00670| The truth of it set Jeanne quivering. 
train_hindifullfemale_00671| Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon. 
train_hindifullfemale_00672| You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_00673| He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break. 
train_hindifullfemale_00674| In it there was something that was almost tragedy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00675| Your face is red with blood. 
train_hindifullfemale_00676| Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_00677| He can care for himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_00678| They will search for us between their camp and Churchill. 
train_hindifullfemale_00679| Until I die, he exclaimed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00680| Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils. 
train_hindifullfemale_00681| The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00682| For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking. 
train_hindifullfemale_00683| I want to die in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00684| Darkness hid him from Jeanne. 
train_hindifullfemale_00685| And yet if she came he had no words to say. 
train_hindifullfemale_00686| He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day. 
train_hindifullfemale_00687| Within himself he called it no longer his own. 
train_hindifullfemale_00688| Besides, that noise makes me deaf. 
train_hindifullfemale_00689| Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00690| Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks. 
train_hindifullfemale_00691| There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne. 
train_hindifullfemale_00692| You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win. 
train_hindifullfemale_00693| I'll only be in the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_00694| He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips. 
train_hindifullfemale_00695| Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body. 
train_hindifullfemale_00696| I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows. 
train_hindifullfemale_00697| For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00698| He was sure, now, of but few things. 
train_hindifullfemale_00699| It was a miracle, and I owe you my life. 
train_hindifullfemale_00700| Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00701| Such men believe, when they come together. 
train_hindifullfemale_00702| The journey was continued at dawn. 
train_hindifullfemale_00703| Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_00704| There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now. 
train_hindifullfemale_00705| He moved his position, and the illusion was gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_00706| For two hours not a word passed between them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00707| I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip. 
train_hindifullfemale_00708| That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer. 
train_hindifullfemale_00709| We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call. 
train_hindifullfemale_00710| Billinger may arrive in time. 
train_hindifullfemale_00711| There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette. 
train_hindifullfemale_00712| I want my men to work by themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00713| Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00714| Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men. 
train_hindifullfemale_00715| Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times. 
train_hindifullfemale_00716| It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear. 
train_hindifullfemale_00717| Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast. 
train_hindifullfemale_00718| He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman. 
train_hindifullfemale_00719| Philip bent low over Pierre. 
train_hindifullfemale_00720| Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill. 
train_hindifullfemale_00721| She saw the answer in his face. 
train_hindifullfemale_00722| Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00723| There is no need of further detail now, for you can understand. 
train_hindifullfemale_00724| There followed a roar that shook the earth. 
train_hindifullfemale_00725| Blind with rage, he darted in. 
train_hindifullfemale_00726| In it was the joy of life. 
train_hindifullfemale_00727| Swiftly his eyes measured the situation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00728| But this little defect did not worry him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00729| And then, steadily, he began to chew. 
train_hindifullfemale_00730| Together they ate the rabbit. 
train_hindifullfemale_00731| They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world. 
train_hindifullfemale_00732| It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits. 
train_hindifullfemale_00733| Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now. 
train_hindifullfemale_00734| It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00735| But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart. 
train_hindifullfemale_00736| Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_00737| After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00738| Had it struck squarely it would have killed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00739| The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce. 
train_hindifullfemale_00740| Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur. 
train_hindifullfemale_00741| And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_00742| It was steel, a fisher trap. 
train_hindifullfemale_00743| OW, a wild dog, he growled. 
train_hindifullfemale_00744| He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home. 
train_hindifullfemale_00745| That is the strange part of it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00746| His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor. 
train_hindifullfemale_00747| For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight. 
train_hindifullfemale_00748| In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle. 
train_hindifullfemale_00749| She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms. 
train_hindifullfemale_00750| His teeth shut with a last click. 
train_hindifullfemale_00751| It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators. 
train_hindifullfemale_00752| In a flash he was on his feet, facing him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00753| He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders. 
train_hindifullfemale_00754| The moon had already begun its westward decline. 
train_hindifullfemale_00755| They laughed like two happy children. 
train_hindifullfemale_00756| He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back. 
train_hindifullfemale_00757| Fast, but endure. 
train_hindifullfemale_00758| A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came. 
train_hindifullfemale_00759| The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart. 
train_hindifullfemale_00760| He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00761| Then he shouted, Shut up. 
train_hindifullfemale_00762| He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair. 
train_hindifullfemale_00763| On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded. 
train_hindifullfemale_00764| To these he gave castor oil. 
train_hindifullfemale_00765| Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing. 
train_hindifullfemale_00766| Sheldon glanced at the thermometer. 
train_hindifullfemale_00767| I'll see to poor Hughie. 
train_hindifullfemale_00768| Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering. 
train_hindifullfemale_00769| Also, I want information. 
train_hindifullfemale_00770| Let them go out and eat with my boys. 
train_hindifullfemale_00771| I, I beg pardon, he drawled. 
train_hindifullfemale_00772| And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt. 
train_hindifullfemale_00773| I was in New York when the crash came. 
train_hindifullfemale_00774| No, I did not fall among thieves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00775| Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips. 
train_hindifullfemale_00776| Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00777| I can't go elsewhere, by your own account. 
train_hindifullfemale_00778| Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation. 
train_hindifullfemale_00779| He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips. 
train_hindifullfemale_00780| That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_00781| Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off. 
train_hindifullfemale_00782| He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons. 
train_hindifullfemale_00783| Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged. 
train_hindifullfemale_00784| So was Packard's finish suicide. 
train_hindifullfemale_00785| Joan cried, with shining eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_00786| Nobody knows how the natives got them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00787| How can you manage all alone, mister Young. 
train_hindifullfemale_00788| The planters are already considering the matter. 
train_hindifullfemale_00789| I use great trouble advisedly. 
train_hindifullfemale_00790| Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time. 
train_hindifullfemale_00791| We leave the eventuality to time and law. 
train_hindifullfemale_00792| I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe. 
train_hindifullfemale_00793| Society is shaken to its foundations. 
train_hindifullfemale_00794| A month in Australia would finish me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00795| Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods. 
train_hindifullfemale_00796| You were destroying my life. 
train_hindifullfemale_00797| Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery. 
train_hindifullfemale_00798| I'm as good as a man, she urged. 
train_hindifullfemale_00799| You read the quotations in today's paper. 
train_hindifullfemale_00800| He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00801| Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi. 
train_hindifullfemale_00802| This is eighteen eighty. 
train_hindifullfemale_00803| Death is and has been ever since old Maui died. 
train_hindifullfemale_00804| Some boy, she laughed acquiescence. 
train_hindifullfemale_00805| Let us talk it over and find a way out. 
train_hindifullfemale_00806| It is a good property, and worth more than that. 
train_hindifullfemale_00807| I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted. 
train_hindifullfemale_00808| Such is my passage engaged on the steamer. 
train_hindifullfemale_00809| The issue was not in doubt. 
train_hindifullfemale_00810| Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all. 
train_hindifullfemale_00811| Harry Bancroft, Dave lied. 
train_hindifullfemale_00812| It's a Yankee, Joan cried. 
train_hindifullfemale_00813| He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant. 
train_hindifullfemale_00814| They likewise are disinclined to being eaten. 
train_hindifullfemale_00815| But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta. 
train_hindifullfemale_00816| The President of the United States was his friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_00817| Your face was the personification of duplicity. 
train_hindifullfemale_00818| Shorty turned to their employers. 
train_hindifullfemale_00819| You were engaged. 
train_hindifullfemale_00820| I saw it all myself, and it was splendid. 
train_hindifullfemale_00821| Now run along, and tell them to hurry. 
train_hindifullfemale_00822| What's that grub thief got to do with it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00823| It was a superb picture. 
train_hindifullfemale_00824| So she said, the irate skipper dashed on. 
train_hindifullfemale_00825| And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_00826| Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard. 
train_hindifullfemale_00827| Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land. 
train_hindifullfemale_00828| They just lay off in the bush and plugged away. 
train_hindifullfemale_00829| The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating. 
train_hindifullfemale_00830| And there was a dog that barked. 
train_hindifullfemale_00831| There are four, all low, McCoy answered. 
train_hindifullfemale_00832| The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley. 
train_hindifullfemale_00833| The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand. 
train_hindifullfemale_00834| They had been on the same lay as ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00835| You are positively soulless, he said savagely. 
train_hindifullfemale_00836| Harrison is still my chauffeur. 
train_hindifullfemale_00837| The boy grew and prospered. 
train_hindifullfemale_00838| He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_00839| Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol. 
train_hindifullfemale_00840| I know they are my oysters. 
train_hindifullfemale_00841| By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek. 
train_hindifullfemale_00842| They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents. 
train_hindifullfemale_00843| It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne. 
train_hindifullfemale_00844| The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds. 
train_hindifullfemale_00845| At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders. 
train_hindifullfemale_00846| Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00847| Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect. 
train_hindifullfemale_00848| Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust. 
train_hindifullfemale_00849| You fired me out of your house, in short. 
train_hindifullfemale_00850| Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh. 
train_hindifullfemale_00851| It's worth eight dollars. 
train_hindifullfemale_00852| And he did hurt my arm. 
train_hindifullfemale_00853| Saxon's onto her job. 
train_hindifullfemale_00854| Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another. 
train_hindifullfemale_00855| But this time it was Saxon who rebelled. 
train_hindifullfemale_00856| I was not to cry out in the face of fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_00857| And now put yourself in my place for a moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00858| The boy threw back his head with pride. 
train_hindifullfemale_00859| Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned. 
train_hindifullfemale_00860| Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot. 
train_hindifullfemale_00861| We could throw stones with our feet. 
train_hindifullfemale_00862| It was put together in a casual, helter skelter sort of way. 
train_hindifullfemale_00863| These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter. 
train_hindifullfemale_00864| Then it was that a strange thing happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_00865| From the source of light a harsh voice said. 
train_hindifullfemale_00866| But I did not enjoy it long. 
train_hindifullfemale_00867| We were now good friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_00868| Two of the Folk were already up. 
train_hindifullfemale_00869| Now animals do not like mockery. 
train_hindifullfemale_00870| He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees. 
train_hindifullfemale_00871| Again the girls applauded, and missus Hall cried. 
train_hindifullfemale_00872| Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion. 
train_hindifullfemale_00873| Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured. 
train_hindifullfemale_00874| But we were without this momentum. 
train_hindifullfemale_00875| There was one difficulty, however. 
train_hindifullfemale_00876| The hyena proceeded to dine. 
train_hindifullfemale_00877| The time was considered auspicious. 
train_hindifullfemale_00878| Or have they already devised one. 
train_hindifullfemale_00879| We would not spend another such night. 
train_hindifullfemale_00880| At first his progress was slow and erratic. 
train_hindifullfemale_00881| He placed his paw on one, and its movements were accelerated. 
train_hindifullfemale_00882| The awe of man rushed over him again. 
train_hindifullfemale_00883| The Fire Men wore animal skins around their waists and across their shoulders. 
train_hindifullfemale_00884| Between him and all domestic animals there must be no hostilities. 
train_hindifullfemale_00885| For a much longer time Lop Ear and I remained and watched. 
train_hindifullfemale_00886| All right, Sir, replied Jock with great regret. 
train_hindifullfemale_00887| At times I wondered where Sir Archibald got his style. 
train_hindifullfemale_00888| Why should a fellow throw up the sponge after the first round. 
train_hindifullfemale_00889| His hand shot out and clutched Crooked Leg by the neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_00890| Miss Brodie's smile was slightly sarcastic. 
train_hindifullfemale_00891| Does the old boy often go off at half cock that way. 
train_hindifullfemale_00892| A flying arrow passed between us. 
train_hindifullfemale_00893| I pulled, suddenly, with all my might. 
train_hindifullfemale_00894| Here we allow our solicitors to look after our legal work. 
train_hindifullfemale_00895| His previous wives had never lived long enough to bear him children. 
train_hindifullfemale_00896| It was our river emerging like ourselves from the great swamp. 
train_hindifullfemale_00897| Cameron looked at his hands with their long, sinewy fingers. 
train_hindifullfemale_00898| We got few vegetables and fruits, and became fish eaters. 
train_hindifullfemale_00899| We never made another migration. 
train_hindifullfemale_00900| Nor was Elam Harnish an exception. 
train_hindifullfemale_00901| A little treatment, massage, with some help from the doctor. 
train_hindifullfemale_00902| The twentyninth very foggy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00903| The apron string loomed near and he shied like an unbroken colt. 
train_hindifullfemale_00904| He had been born with this endowment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00905| And this was their sole conversation throughout the meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_00906| Though the aurora still flamed, another day had begun. 
train_hindifullfemale_00907| He did not believe in the burning of daylight for such a luxury. 
train_hindifullfemale_00908| Again he had done the big thing. 
train_hindifullfemale_00909| Daylight was tired, profoundly tired. 
train_hindifullfemale_00910| The regret in his voice was provocative of a second burst of laughter. 
train_hindifullfemale_00911| Instead, he arrived on the night of the second day. 
train_hindifullfemale_00912| Their supply of grub was gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_00913| Crickets began to chirp, and more geese and ducks flew overhead. 
train_hindifullfemale_00914| Not till the twentieth of May did the river break. 
train_hindifullfemale_00915| It was a gigantic inadequacy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00916| Our mister Howison will call upon you at the hotel. 
train_hindifullfemale_00917| He had been so easy. 
train_hindifullfemale_00918| Change chairs, Daylight commanded. 
train_hindifullfemale_00919| I'd sooner have my chips back. 
train_hindifullfemale_00920| They only had a little thirty thousand dollar fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_00921| His partners had starved and died on the Stewart. 
train_hindifullfemale_00922| As to how she dressed, he had no ideas at all. 
train_hindifullfemale_00923| It does, was her audacious answer. 
train_hindifullfemale_00924| Oh, it's just a novel, a love story. 
train_hindifullfemale_00925| Whoever lived on the ranch did that. 
train_hindifullfemale_00926| How old are you, mother. 
train_hindifullfemale_00927| Here he got a fresh thrill. 
train_hindifullfemale_00928| It was unobtrusive, yet it was there. 
train_hindifullfemale_00929| Well, I'll be plumb gosh darned. 
train_hindifullfemale_00930| These quick little joys of hers were sources of joy to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00931| I play that choice wide open to win. 
train_hindifullfemale_00932| Each improvement makes the value of everything else pump up. 
train_hindifullfemale_00933| But how are you going to do it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00934| Lots of men take women buggy riding. 
train_hindifullfemale_00935| Daylight made no answer, and the door closed behind him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00936| There is not an iota of truth in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00937| But ever his gaze returned to that Crouched Venus on the piano. 
train_hindifullfemale_00938| Would you be satisfied with that one hundredth part of me. 
train_hindifullfemale_00939| In such a tumbling of values was no time to sell. 
train_hindifullfemale_00940| Stand off butcher and baker and all the rest. 
train_hindifullfemale_00941| Matthewson, who's this bookkeeper, Rogers. 
train_hindifullfemale_00942| Now just what do you want to know. 
train_hindifullfemale_00943| I want to know how all this is possible. 
train_hindifullfemale_00944| It's that much junk. 
train_hindifullfemale_00945| There was proper division of labor in the work they individually performed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00946| He loved to play Chinese lottery. 
train_hindifullfemale_00947| The Law of Club and Fang 
train_hindifullfemale_00948| The temperature dropped to fifty below zero and remained there the whole trip. 
train_hindifullfemale_00949| And as never before, he was ready to obey. 
train_hindifullfemale_00950| This state of mind comes on an undue prominence of the ego. 
train_hindifullfemale_00951| There are the canals of China, and the Yangtse River. 
train_hindifullfemale_00952| We threaten to be of the one mind before the voyage is completed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00953| She was built primarily to sail. 
train_hindifullfemale_00954| In the Bohemian Club of San Francisco there are some crack sailors. 
train_hindifullfemale_00955| My age, in years, is twenty two. 
train_hindifullfemale_00956| I forgot how easily I had taught myself from the printed page. 
train_hindifullfemale_00957| Any average young fellow can teach himself in a week. 
train_hindifullfemale_00958| Please do not think that I already know it all. 
train_hindifullfemale_00959| You see, we were teaching ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00960| And now behold the perversity of things. 
train_hindifullfemale_00961| Yield yourself to the waters that are ripping and tearing at you. 
train_hindifullfemale_00962| mister McVeigh told me about him. 
train_hindifullfemale_00963| Unlike Joshua, he stood in no need of divine assistance. 
train_hindifullfemale_00964| To say the least, Captain Cook was a rather thorough going empiricist. 
train_hindifullfemale_00965| Man could not conquer them. 
train_hindifullfemale_00966| Thought I, and a worthy fool he proved. 
train_hindifullfemale_00967| A scarlet loincloth completed his costume. 
train_hindifullfemale_00968| I like to speculate upon the glorious future of man. 
train_hindifullfemale_00969| Christmas is an easy problem compared with a Polynesian giving feast. 
train_hindifullfemale_00970| He had peeled off his shirt and was wildly waving it. 
train_hindifullfemale_00971| And how would we ever find ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_00972| I defy any man to get a Solomon Island sore in California. 
train_hindifullfemale_00973| A bush chief had died a natural death. 
train_hindifullfemale_00974| The skipper's and Nakata's gymnastics served as a translation without words. 
train_hindifullfemale_00975| Last night he showed all the symptoms of coming down with pneumonia. 
train_hindifullfemale_00976| My idea was that he would have more influence over the natives. 
train_hindifullfemale_00977| It is merely the simple superlative. 
train_hindifullfemale_00978| I made no more overtures. 
train_hindifullfemale_00979| Among my minor afflictions, I may mention a new and mysterious one. 
train_hindifullfemale_00980| The voyage was our idea of a good time. 
train_hindifullfemale_00981| At sea, Tuesday, March seventeen, nineteen hundred and eight. 
train_hindifullfemale_00982| Yes, sir, he answered, with cheerful alacrity. 
train_hindifullfemale_00983| I was still weak from my prolonged immersion. 
train_hindifullfemale_00984| The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper. 
train_hindifullfemale_00985| I was beneath the water, suffocating and drowning. 
train_hindifullfemale_00986| The pain from my hurt knee was agonizing. 
train_hindifullfemale_00987| The hunters were still arguing and roaring like some semi human amphibious breed. 
train_hindifullfemale_00988| I have been robbed, sir, I amended. 
train_hindifullfemale_00989| You were looking squeamish this afternoon, he began. 
train_hindifullfemale_00990| How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_00991| I learned it myself in English ships. 
train_hindifullfemale_00992| An altruistic act is an act performed for the welfare of others. 
train_hindifullfemale_00993| Knowing him, I review the old Scandinavian myths with clearer understanding. 
train_hindifullfemale_00994| Yes, and no, sir, was the slow reply. 
train_hindifullfemale_00995| And each year something happened, and I did not go. 
train_hindifullfemale_00996| How in hell did he know it was you in the dark. 
train_hindifullfemale_00997| Of course much grumbling went on, and little outbursts were continually occurring. 
train_hindifullfemale_00998| You have all the advantage. 
train_hindifullfemale_00999| The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in his sheath on my hip. 
train_hindifullfemale_01000| Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labour. 
train_hindifullfemale_01001| He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough. 
train_hindifullfemale_01002| Ah, it was sweet in my ears. 
train_hindifullfemale_01003| He may desire to escape pain, or to enjoy pleasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_01004| It was impossible to hoist sail and claw off that shore. 
train_hindifullfemale_01005| There was nothing for us but the wide raw ocean. 
train_hindifullfemale_01006| I arose obediently and went down the beach. 
train_hindifullfemale_01007| The next thing to watch out for is bed sores. 
train_hindifullfemale_01008| At that moment I got the impression that she was willowy. 
train_hindifullfemale_01009| Your father's fifth command, he nodded. 
train_hindifullfemale_01010| On occasion, on this traverse, the Cape Verde Islands are raised. 
train_hindifullfemale_01011| She is essentially the life giving, life conserving female of the species. 
train_hindifullfemale_01012| This was when the explosion occurred. 
train_hindifullfemale_01013| Also, at regular intervals, he would mutter. 
train_hindifullfemale_01014| It is a very tenable hypothesis, and will bear looking into. 
train_hindifullfemale_01015| There were orange green, gold green, and a copper green. 
train_hindifullfemale_01016| The Gabriel voice of the Samurai rang out. 
train_hindifullfemale_01017| The sunsets grow more bizarre and spectacular off this coast of the Argentine. 
train_hindifullfemale_01018| The history of our westward faring race is written in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01019| And the Eurasian Chinese Englishman bowed himself away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01020| They were babbling and chattering all together. 
train_hindifullfemale_01021| Too much, he told me, with ominous rolling head. 
train_hindifullfemale_01022| He is a candidate, rising from the serf class to our class. 
train_hindifullfemale_01023| We are cooking on the coal stove and on the oil burners. 
train_hindifullfemale_01024| The steward had just tendered me, a respectful bit of advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_01025| Well, did they eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_01026| Famine had been my great ally. 
train_hindifullfemale_01027| Nowhere in the North is the soil so prolific. 
train_hindifullfemale_01028| They ran the canoe in and climbed the high earth bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_01029| The land exchanged its austere robes for the garb of a smiling wanton. 
train_hindifullfemale_01030| There were stir and bustle, new faces, and fresh facts. 
train_hindifullfemale_01031| And there was Ethel Baird, whom also you must remember. 
train_hindifullfemale_01032| He had become a man very early in life. 
train_hindifullfemale_01033| I did not think you would be so early. 
train_hindifullfemale_01034| He did not know what went on in the minds of his superiors. 
train_hindifullfemale_01035| Mops, sir, eagerly answered the sailor at the wheel. 
train_hindifullfemale_01036| Some one had thrust a large sheath knife into his hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_01037| O'Brien emitted a shriek that sank swiftly to a gurgling sob. 
train_hindifullfemale_01038| Sandel would never become a world champion. 
train_hindifullfemale_01039| Also, she wouldn't walk. 
train_hindifullfemale_01040| To my dearest and always appreciated friend, I submit myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_01041| You used to joyride like the very devil. 
train_hindifullfemale_01042| They saw each other for the first time in Boston. 
train_hindifullfemale_01043| Isaac Ford, the austere soldier of the Lord, the old hypocrite. 
train_hindifullfemale_01044| Eighteen, he added. 
train_hindifullfemale_01045| His reward should have been peace and repose. 
train_hindifullfemale_01046| He was an amphibian and a mountaineer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01047| It was sanctification and salvation. 
train_hindifullfemale_01048| The history of the eighteenth century is written, Ernest prompted. 
train_hindifullfemale_01049| They are not biologists nor sociologists. 
train_hindifullfemale_01050| The more his opponents grew excited, the more Ernest deliberately excited them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01051| By virtue of that power we shall remain in power. 
train_hindifullfemale_01052| One guess will do, Ernest retorted. 
train_hindifullfemale_01053| Take my advice and accept the vacation. 
train_hindifullfemale_01054| I could not agree with Ernest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01055| But such divergence of opinion would constitute no menace to society. 
train_hindifullfemale_01056| It is dog eat dog, and you ate them up. 
train_hindifullfemale_01057| Let us run them for ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_01058| It was introduced by Representative Dick of Ohio. 
train_hindifullfemale_01059| Very few people knew of the existence of this law. 
train_hindifullfemale_01060| The very thing, Ernest agreed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01061| Also a fellow Senator, Chauncey Depew, said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01062| Ernest saw in the affair the most sinister import. 
train_hindifullfemale_01063| Then there was the campaign. 
train_hindifullfemale_01064| He was manifestly distressed by my coming. 
train_hindifullfemale_01065| Not a wheel moved in his empire. 
train_hindifullfemale_01066| The reorganization of these countries took the form of revolution. 
train_hindifullfemale_01067| You're going in for grab sharing. 
train_hindifullfemale_01068| The Oligarchy will encourage such ambition and the consequent competition. 
train_hindifullfemale_01069| Violation of this law was made a high misdemeanor and punished accordingly. 
train_hindifullfemale_01070| Without discussion, it was the agents provocateurs who caused the Peasant Revolt. 
train_hindifullfemale_01071| The task we set ourselves was threefold. 
train_hindifullfemale_01072| Many other similar disconcerting omissions will be noticed in the Manuscript. 
train_hindifullfemale_01073| The flower of the artistic and intellectual world were revolutionists. 
train_hindifullfemale_01074| This the Iron Heel foresaw and laid its schemes accordingly. 
train_hindifullfemale_01075| The mob came on, but it could not advance. 
train_hindifullfemale_01076| But why continue the tirade, for tirade it was. 
train_hindifullfemale_01077| After all superfluous flesh is gone what is left is stringy and resistant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01078| Beyond refusing to sell us food, they left us to ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_01079| He was a merry monarch, especially so for an Asiatic. 
train_hindifullfemale_01080| What an excited whispering and conferring took place. 
train_hindifullfemale_01081| Jacob Brinker, who was his roadmate, brought the news. 
train_hindifullfemale_01082| Thus he turned the tenets and jargon of psychology back on me. 
train_hindifullfemale_01083| You yellow giant thing of the frost. 
train_hindifullfemale_01084| Never so strange a prophet came up to Jerusalem. 
train_hindifullfemale_01085| We who have endured so much surely can endure a little more. 
train_hindifullfemale_01086| I have seen myself that one man contemplated by Pascal's philosophic eye. 
train_hindifullfemale_01087| One great drawback to farming in California is our long dry summer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01088| I remembered the red wine of the Italian rancho, and shuddered inwardly. 
train_hindifullfemale_01089| I said, and dismissed the matter as not worth thinking about. 
train_hindifullfemale_01090| Then came my boy code. 
train_hindifullfemale_01091| And wherever I ranged, the way lay along alcohol drenched roads. 
train_hindifullfemale_01092| And as we hurried up town, Joe Goose explained. 
train_hindifullfemale_01093| The scents of strange vegetation blew off the tropic land. 
train_hindifullfemale_01094| The life there was healthful and athletic, but too juvenile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01095| How valiantly I went at it that first day. 
train_hindifullfemale_01096| It would help to tide me along until I got steady employment. 
train_hindifullfemale_01097| Did I possess too much vitality. 
train_hindifullfemale_01098| In his anxiety and solicitude and love they did not count. 
train_hindifullfemale_01099| He had fulfilled his duty and paid properly. 
train_hindifullfemale_01100| He knew what taboos he was violating. 
train_hindifullfemale_01101| Do you value your hide. 
train_hindifullfemale_01102| You should have seen them when they heard me spitting Chinook. 
train_hindifullfemale_01103| He plodded on for half an hour, when the hallucination arose again. 
train_hindifullfemale_01104| Tomorrow or next day it might he gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_01105| But already he had composed himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_01106| Zilla relaxed her sour mouth long enough to sigh her satisfaction. 
train_hindifullfemale_01107| Eggshell is not good to eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_01108| But there was also talk of witchcraft in the village. 
train_hindifullfemale_01109| Yea, I will tell thee. 
train_hindifullfemale_01110| Hans hurled himself upon the prostrate man, striking madly with his fists. 
train_hindifullfemale_01111| And he thought of Oona, and of her words. 
train_hindifullfemale_01112| Nor would it thaw out his hands and feet. 
train_hindifullfemale_01113| The Russian music player, the Count, was her obedient slave. 
train_hindifullfemale_01114| So far as flags were concerned, they were beyond all jurisdiction. 
train_hindifullfemale_01115| New idea, he volunteered, brand new idea. 
train_hindifullfemale_01116| Thirty pounds, said the captain with finality. 
train_hindifullfemale_01117| The very idea of it was preposterous. 
train_hindifullfemale_01118| Captain Doane's orders were swiftly obeyed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01119| Come on, Del Mar challenged. 
train_hindifullfemale_01120| He had a big chimpanzee that was a winner. 
train_hindifullfemale_01121| I am sure it must have been some adventure. 
train_hindifullfemale_01122| That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry. 
train_hindifullfemale_01123| His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form. 
train_hindifullfemale_01124| I'll tell you, the librarian said with a brightening face. 
train_hindifullfemale_01125| He read his fragments aloud. 
train_hindifullfemale_01126| Typhoid did I tell you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01127| But she had become an automaton. 
train_hindifullfemale_01128| At the best, they were necessary accessories. 
train_hindifullfemale_01129| You were making them talk shop, Ruth charged him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01130| Once upon a time there was a fine stag who ruled a herd of deer in a forest and it had a beautiful wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_01131| The doe was very devoted to her husband and helped him in all matters of life. 
train_hindifullfemale_01132| One day, the stag was caught in the trap of a hunter and the doe was very frightened as was the stag. 
train_hindifullfemale_01133| All the friends of the stag left him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01134| But the doe remained steadfast next to him and waited for the hunter to come. 
train_hindifullfemale_01135| She was very devoted to her husband. 
train_hindifullfemale_01136| As soon as the hunter came, she fell on his knees and begged, Sir! Please make a nice bed of leaves for me. 
train_hindifullfemale_01137| Kill me first and then my husband and you can have a nice feast. 
train_hindifullfemale_01138| The hunter was so amazed and surprised by her love that he went to first free the stag before he prepared the bed of leaves. 
train_hindifullfemale_01139| In that split second, the stag and the doe ran after being free. 
train_hindifullfemale_01140| The moral of the story is Great love can achieve anything. 
train_hindifullfemale_01141| Once upon a time there was a fine pigeon who used to live on a nest close to a kitchen. 
train_hindifullfemale_01142| The cooks of the kitchen used to like her very much and often used to feed her grain. 
train_hindifullfemale_01143| She liked the place and her life was fine. 
train_hindifullfemale_01144| One day a crow saw the pigeon and saw how it was getting wonderful food from the kitchen. 
train_hindifullfemale_01145| Then one day the crow made friendship with the pigeon. 
train_hindifullfemale_01146| Under the pretext of friendship, the crow somehow made the pigeon share the nest with her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01147| The pigeon then told her that they could spend time together discussing politics, religion, etcetera but when it came to food both had their own ways. 
train_hindifullfemale_01148| So she suggested the crow search for her own food. 
train_hindifullfemale_01149| But the crow was impatient and the very reason she had made friends with the pigeon was for the food. 
train_hindifullfemale_01150| The crow wanted meat and all the pigeon got was grains from the kitchen. 
train_hindifullfemale_01151| It could not wait any longer and ultimately decided that she will visit the kitchen and go directly for the food. 
train_hindifullfemale_01152| Thinking so, it stealthily crept down the chimney into the kitchen. 
train_hindifullfemale_01153| She got the smell of a fish being curried on the pan. 
train_hindifullfemale_01154| She got greedy and went ahead and tried to get the fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01155| But in the process, she disturbed a ladle, and created a noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_01156| This alerted the cook who was in the neighbouring room and he caught hold of the crow and killed it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01157| This moral of the story is that Greed Numbs intelligence. 
train_hindifullfemale_01158| Once upon a time there was a lion in a jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_01159| Once when he had gone to drink water in a stream, his feet got stuck in the wet slushy mud of the stream and he could not get out. 
train_hindifullfemale_01160| He had to lie without food for days as he saw no help coming by. 
train_hindifullfemale_01161| One day, a kind jackal came by and the jackal dug a way out from the sand. 
train_hindifullfemale_01162| With the extra force he helped the lion get out of the slush and set him free. 
train_hindifullfemale_01163| The lion was grateful for this and thanked the jackal for saving his life. 
train_hindifullfemale_01164| He then offered the jackal to live close to him and also promised to feed him whenever he caught food. 
train_hindifullfemale_01165| So the jackal started living with the lion and they shared the hunt. 
train_hindifullfemale_01166| Soon they expanded their families and had cubs and kid jackals. 
train_hindifullfemale_01167| After a long time, the lioness, lady of the lion's house, grew tired of the friendship of the jackal and her master. 
train_hindifullfemale_01168| She did not know that the jackal had saved lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_01169| She conveyed the message to her cubs who conveyed the message to the jackal kids and the message reached the lady jackal. 
train_hindifullfemale_01170| The lady jackal told of this to her husband. 
train_hindifullfemale_01171| The jackal went to the lion, and told him that if he did not want the jackal to stay with him, he should have told him long time back. 
train_hindifullfemale_01172| The lion was surprised at this and assured the jackal that no such ill feelings existed in his mind and assured him that he would talk to the lioness. 
train_hindifullfemale_01173| But the wise jackal then said, Friend, I know you are sincere. 
train_hindifullfemale_01174| But our families may not exactly reciprocate the same level of friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_01175| So let us stay apart, and meet often as friends and even go for killing together. 
train_hindifullfemale_01176| But it is better if my family stays apart from yours. 
train_hindifullfemale_01177| The lion agreed to this and the two families parted as friends and the jackal and the lion were still close friends and used to go for kills together. 
train_hindifullfemale_01178| The moral of the story is that do not expect your family to reciprocate the same kind of friendship you do. 
train_hindifullfemale_01179| A monkey lived in a great tree on a river bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_01180| In the river there were many crocodiles. 
train_hindifullfemale_01181| A crocodile watched the monkey for a long time, and one day she said to her son, My son, get one of those monkeys for me to eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_01182| I want the heart of a monkey to eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_01183| How am I to catch a monkey? asked the little crocodile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01184| I do not travel on land, and the monkey does not go into the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01185| Put your wits to work, and you will find a way, said the mother. 
train_hindifullfemale_01186| And the little crocodile thought and thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_01187| At last he said to himself, I know what to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_01188| I will get that monkey, that lives in a big tree on the river bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_01189| He wishes to go across the river to the island where the fruit is so ripe. 
train_hindifullfemale_01190| So the crocodile swam to the tree where the monkey lived. 
train_hindifullfemale_01191| But he was a stupid crocodile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01192| Oh, monkey! he called. Come with me over to the island where the fruit is so ripe. 
train_hindifullfemale_01193| How can I go with you? I do not swim, said the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_01194| No, but I do. I will take you over on my back, said the crocodile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01195| The monkey was greedy, and he wanted the ripe fruit. 
train_hindifullfemale_01196| So he jumped down on the crocodile's back. 
train_hindifullfemale_01197| Here we go, said the crocodile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01198| This is a fine ride you are giving me! said the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_01199| Do you think so? Well, how do you like this? asked the crocodile, diving. 
train_hindifullfemale_01200| Oh, do not! cried the monkey, as he went under the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01201| He was afraid to let go, and he did not know what to do under the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01202| When the crocodile came up, the monkey sputtered and choked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01203| Why did you take me under water, crocodile? he asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01204| I am going to kill you by keeping you under water, answered the crocodile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01205| My mother wants monkey heart to eat, and I am going to take yours to her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01206| I wish you had told me you wanted my heart, said the monkey, then I might have brought it with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_01207| What are you saying? asked the stupid crocodile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01208| Do you mean to say that you left your heart back there in the tree? 
train_hindifullfemale_01209| That is what I mean, said the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_01210| If you want my heart, we must go back to the tree and get it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01211| But we are so near the island where the ripe fruit is, please take me there first. 
train_hindifullfemale_01212| No monkey, said the crocodile, I will take you straight back to your tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_01213| Never mind the ripe fruit. Get your heart and bring it to me at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_01214| Then we will see about going to the island. 
train_hindifullfemale_01215| Very well, said the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_01216| But as soon as the crocodile reached the river bank the monkey jumped onto the bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_01217| Then he ran to the top of the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_01218| From the topmost branches he called down to the crocodile in the water below, My heart is way up here! If you want it, come for it! 
train_hindifullfemale_01219| The monkey soon moved away from that tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_01220| He wanted to get away from the crocodile, so he might live in peace. 
train_hindifullfemale_01221| But the crocodile found him, far down the river, living in another tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_01222| In the middle of the river was an island covered with fruit trees. 
train_hindifullfemale_01223| Half way between the bank of the river and the island, a large rock rose out of the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01224| The monkey could jump to the rock, and then to the island. 
train_hindifullfemale_01225| The crocodile watched the monkey crossing from the bank of the river to the rock, and then to the island. 
train_hindifullfemale_01226| He thought to himself, The monkey will stay on the island all day, and I will catch him on his way home at night. 
train_hindifullfemale_01227| The monkey had a fine feast, while the crocodile swam about, watching him all day. 
train_hindifullfemale_01228| Toward night, the crocodile crawled out of the water and lay on the rock, perfectly still. 
train_hindifullfemale_01229| When it grew dark among the trees, the monkey started for home. 
train_hindifullfemale_01230| He ran down to the river bank, and there he stopped. 
train_hindifullfemale_01231| What is the matter with the rock? the monkey thought to himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_01232| I never saw it so high before. The crocodile is lying on it! 
train_hindifullfemale_01233| But he went to the edge of the water and called, Hello, Rock! 
train_hindifullfemale_01234| No answer. Then he called again, Hello, Rock! 
train_hindifullfemale_01235| Three times the monkey called, and then he said, Why is it, Friend Rock, that you do not answer me tonight? 
train_hindifullfemale_01236| Oh, said the stupid crocodile to himself, the rock answers the monkey at night. 
train_hindifullfemale_01237| I have to answer for the rock this time. 
train_hindifullfemale_01238| So he answered, Yes, monkey! What is it? 
train_hindifullfemale_01239| The monkey laughed, and said, Oh, it is you, crocodile, is it? 
train_hindifullfemale_01240| Yes, I am waiting here for you. I am going to eat you, said the crocodile. 
train_hindifullfemale_01241| You have caught me in a trap this time, said the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_01242| There is no other way for me to go home. 
train_hindifullfemale_01243| Open your mouth wide so I can jump right into it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01244| Now the monkey well knew that when crocodiles open their mouths wide, they shut their eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_01245| While the crocodile lay on the rock with his mouth wide open and his eyes shut, the monkey jumped. 
train_hindifullfemale_01246| But not into his mouth. He landed on the top of the crocodile's head, and then sprang quickly to the bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_01247| As before, he whisked into his tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_01248| The crocodile saw the trick the monkey had played on him, and admired him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01249| He said, monkey, you have a great cunning mind. You have no fear. I will let you alone after this. 
train_hindifullfemale_01250| Thank you, crocodile, but I shall be on the watch for you just the same, said the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_01251| A king once had a lake made in the courtyard for the young princes to play in. 
train_hindifullfemale_01252| They swam about in it, and sailed their boats and rafts on it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01253| One day the king told them he had asked the men to put some fishes into the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_01254| On hearing the news the boys ran to see the fishes. 
train_hindifullfemale_01255| Now, along with the fishes, there was a turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_01256| The boys were delighted with the fishes, but they had never seen a turtle, and they were afraid of it, thinking it was a demon. 
train_hindifullfemale_01257| They ran back to their father, crying, There is a demon on the bank of the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_01258| The king ordered his men to catch the demon, and to bring it to the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_01259| When the turtle was brought in, the boys cried and ran away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01260| The king was very fond of his sons, so he ordered the men who had brought the turtle to kill it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01261| How shall we kill it, they asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01262| Pound it to powder, said some one. 
train_hindifullfemale_01263| Bake it in hot coals, said another. 
train_hindifullfemale_01264| So one plan after another was spoken of. 
train_hindifullfemale_01265| Then an old man who had always been afraid of the water said, Throw the thing into the lake where it flows out over the rocks into the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_01266| Then it will surely be killed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01267| When the turtle heard what the old man said, he thrust out his head and asked, Friend, what have I done that you should do such a dreadful thing as that to me? 
train_hindifullfemale_01268| The other plans were bad enough, but to throw me into the lake! do not speak of such a cruel thing! 
train_hindifullfemale_01269| When the king heard what the turtle said, he told his men to take the turtle at once and throw it into the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_01270| The turtle laughed to himself as he slid away down the river to his old home. 
train_hindifullfemale_01271| Good! he said, those people do not know how safe I am in the water! 
train_hindifullfemale_01272| There was once a merchant of Seri who sold brass and tinware. 
train_hindifullfemale_01273| He went from town to town, with another man, who also sold brass and tinware. 
train_hindifullfemale_01274| This second man was greedy, getting all he could for nothing, and giving as little as he could for what he bought. 
train_hindifullfemale_01275| When they went into a town, they divided the streets between them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01276| Each man went up and down the streets he had chosen, calling, Tinware for sale. Brass for sale. 
train_hindifullfemale_01277| People came out to their door steps, and bought, or traded, with them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01278| In one house there lived a poor old woman and her granddaughter. 
train_hindifullfemale_01279| The family had once been rich, but now the only thing they had left of all their riches was a golden bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_01280| The grandmother did not know it was a golden bowl, but she had kept this because her husband used to eat out of it in the old days. 
train_hindifullfemale_01281| It stood on a shelf among the other pots and pans, and was not often used. 
train_hindifullfemale_01282| The greedy merchant passed this house, calling, Buy my water jars! Buy my pans!. 
train_hindifullfemale_01283| The granddaughter said, Oh, Grandmother, do buy something for me! 
train_hindifullfemale_01284| My dear, said the old woman, we are too poor to buy anything. I have not anything to trade. 
train_hindifullfemale_01285| Grandmother, see what the merchant will give for the old bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_01286| We do not use that, and perhaps he will take it and give us something we want for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01287| The old woman called the merchant and showed him the bowl, saying, Will you take this, sir, and give the little girl here something for it? 
train_hindifullfemale_01288| The greedy man took the bowl and scratched its side with a needle. 
train_hindifullfemale_01289| Thus he found that it was a golden bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_01290| He hoped he could get it for nothing, so he said, What is this worth? Not even a halfpenny. 
train_hindifullfemale_01291| He threw the bowl on the ground, and went away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01292| By and by the other merchant passed the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_01293| For it was agreed that either merchant might go through any street which the other had left. 
train_hindifullfemale_01294| He called, Buy my water jars! Buy my tinware! Buy my brass! 
train_hindifullfemale_01295| The little girl heard him, and begged her grandmother to see what he would give for the bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_01296| My child, said the grandmother, the merchant who was here threw the bowl on the ground and went away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01297| I have nothing else to offer in trade. 
train_hindifullfemale_01298| But, Grandmother, said the girl, that was a cross man. This one looks pleasant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01299| Ask him. Perhaps he will give some little tin dish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01300| As soon as the merchant took the bowl in his hands, he knew it was of gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_01301| He said, All that I have here is not worth so much as this bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_01302| It is a golden bowl. I am not rich enough to buy it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01303| But sir, a merchant who passed here a few moments ago, threw it on the ground, saying, it was not worth half a penny, and he went away, said the grandmother. 
train_hindifullfemale_01304| It was worth nothing to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01305| If you value it, take it, giving the little girl some dish, she likes for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01306| But the merchant would not have it so. 
train_hindifullfemale_01307| He gave the woman all the money he had, and all his wares. 
train_hindifullfemale_01308| Give me but eight pennies, he said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01309| So he took the pennies, and left. 
train_hindifullfemale_01310| Going quickly to the river, he paid the boatman the eight pennies to take him across the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_01311| Soon the greedy merchant went back to the house where he had seen the golden bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_01312| He said, Bring that bowl to me, and I will give you something for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01313| No, said the grandmother. You said the bowl was worthless, but another merchant has paid a great price for it, and taken it away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01314| Then the greedy merchant was angry, crying out, Through this other man I have lost a small fortune. That bowl was of gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_01315| He ran down to the riverside, and, seeing the other merchant in the boat out in the river, he called, Hello, Boatman! Stop your boat! 
train_hindifullfemale_01316| But the man in the boat said, do not stop! 
train_hindifullfemale_01317| So he reached the city on the other side of the river, and lived well for a time on the money the bowl brought him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01318| A turtle lived in a pond at the foot of a hill. 
train_hindifullfemale_01319| Two young wild Geese, looking for food, saw the turtle, and talked with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01320| The next day the Geese came again to visit the turtle and they became very well acquainted. 
train_hindifullfemale_01321| Soon they were great friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_01322| Friend turtle, the Geese said one day, we have a beautiful home far away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01323| We are going to fly back to it tomorrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_01324| It will be a long but pleasant journey. Will you go with us? 
train_hindifullfemale_01325| How could I? I have no wings, said the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_01326| Oh, we will take you, if only you can keep your mouth shut, and say not a word to anybody, they said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01327| I can do that, said the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_01328| Do take me with you, I will do exactly as you wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01329| So the next day the Geese brought a stick and they held the ends of it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01330| Now take the middle of this in your mouth, and do not say a word until we reach home, they said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01331| The Geese then sprang into the air, with the turtle between them, holding fast to the stick. 
train_hindifullfemale_01332| The village children saw the two Geese flying along with the turtle and cried out, Oh, see the turtle up in the air! 
train_hindifullfemale_01333| Look at the Geese carrying a turtle by a stick! Did you ever see anything more ridiculous in your life! 
train_hindifullfemale_01334| The turtle looked down and began to say, Well, and if my friends carry me, what business is that of yours? when he let go, and fell dead at the feet of the children. 
train_hindifullfemale_01335| As the two Geese flew on, they heard the people say, when they came to see the poor turtle, That fellow could not keep his mouth shut. 
train_hindifullfemale_01336| He had to talk, and so lost his life. 
train_hindifullfemale_01337| Long ago a man owned a very strong Ox. 
train_hindifullfemale_01338| The owner was so proud of his Ox, that he boasted to every man he met about how strong his Ox was. 
train_hindifullfemale_01339| One day the owner went into a village, and said to the men there as this. 
train_hindifullfemale_01340| I will pay a fortune of a thousand pieces of silver if my strong Ox cannot draw a line of one hundred wagons. 
train_hindifullfemale_01341| The men laughed, and said, Very well, bring your Ox, and we will tie a hundred wagons in a line and see your Ox draw them along. 
train_hindifullfemale_01342| So the man brought his Ox into the village. 
train_hindifullfemale_01343| A crowd gathered to see the sight. 
train_hindifullfemale_01344| The hundred carts were in line, and the strong Ox was yoked to the first wagon. 
train_hindifullfemale_01345| Then the owner whipped his Ox. 
train_hindifullfemale_01346| But the Ox had never been talked to in that way, and he stood still. 
train_hindifullfemale_01347| Neither the blows nor the hard names could make him move. 
train_hindifullfemale_01348| At last the poor man paid his forfeit, and went sadly home. 
train_hindifullfemale_01349| There he threw himself on his bed and cried, Why did that strong Ox act so? 
train_hindifullfemale_01350| Many a time he has moved heavier loads easily. 
train_hindifullfemale_01351| Why did he shame me before all those people? 
train_hindifullfemale_01352| At last he got up and went about his work. 
train_hindifullfemale_01353| When he went to feed the Ox that night, the Ox turned to him and said, Why did you whip me today? 
train_hindifullfemale_01354| You never whipped me before. You never called me hard names before. 
train_hindifullfemale_01355| Then the man said, I will never treat you badly again. 
train_hindifullfemale_01356| I am sorry I whipped you and called you bad names. 
train_hindifullfemale_01357| I will never do so any more. Forgive me. Very well, said the Ox. 
train_hindifullfemale_01358| Tomorrow I will go into the village and draw the one hundred carts for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01359| You have always been a kind master until today. 
train_hindifullfemale_01360| Tomorrow you shall gain what you lost. 
train_hindifullfemale_01361| The next morning the owner fed the Ox well, and hung a garland of flowers about his neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_01362| When they went into the village the men laughed at the man again. 
train_hindifullfemale_01363| They said, Did you come back to lose more money? 
train_hindifullfemale_01364| Today I will pay a fortune of two thousand pieces of silver if my Ox is not strong enough to pull the one hundred carts, said the owner. 
train_hindifullfemale_01365| So again the carts were placed in a line, and the Ox was yoked to the first. 
train_hindifullfemale_01366| A crowd came to watch again. 
train_hindifullfemale_01367| The owner said, Good Ox, show how strong you are! You fine creature!. 
train_hindifullfemale_01368| And he patted his neck and stroked his sides. 
train_hindifullfemale_01369| At once the Ox pulled with all his strength. 
train_hindifullfemale_01370| The carts moved on until the last cart stood where the first had been. 
train_hindifullfemale_01371| Then the crowd shouted, and they paid back the forfeit the man had lost, saying, Your Ox is the strongest Ox we ever saw. 
train_hindifullfemale_01372| And the Ox and the man went home, happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_01373| Once upon a time a merchant, with his goods packed in many carts, came to a desert. 
train_hindifullfemale_01374| He was on his way to the country on the other side of the desert. 
train_hindifullfemale_01375| The sun shone on the fine sand, making it as hot as the top of a stove. 
train_hindifullfemale_01376| No man could walk on it in the sunlight. 
train_hindifullfemale_01377| But at night, after the sun went down, the sand cooled, and then men could travel upon it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01378| So the merchant waited until after dark, and then set out. 
train_hindifullfemale_01379| Besides the goods that he was going to sell, he took jars of water and rice, and firewood, so that the rice could be cooked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01380| All night long he and his men rode on and on. 
train_hindifullfemale_01381| One man was the pilot, and he rode first, for he knew the stars, and by them he guided the drivers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01382| At daybreak they stopped and camped. 
train_hindifullfemale_01383| They unyoked the oxen, and fed them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01384| They built fires and cooked the rice. 
train_hindifullfemale_01385| Then they spread a great awning over all the carts and the oxen, and the men lay down under it to rest until sunset. 
train_hindifullfemale_01386| In the early evening, they again built fires and cooked rice. 
train_hindifullfemale_01387| After supper, they folded the awning and put it away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01388| They yoked the oxen, and, as soon as the sand was cool, they started again on their journey across the desert. 
train_hindifullfemale_01389| Night after night they travelled in this way, resting during the heat of the day. 
train_hindifullfemale_01390| At last one morning the pilot said, In one more night we shall get out of the sand. 
train_hindifullfemale_01391| The men were glad to hear this, for they were tired. 
train_hindifullfemale_01392| After supper that night the merchant said, You may as well throw away nearly all the water and the firewood. 
train_hindifullfemale_01393| By tomorrow we shall be in the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_01394| Yoke the oxen and start on. 
train_hindifullfemale_01395| Then the pilot took his place at the head of the line. 
train_hindifullfemale_01396| But, instead of sitting up and guiding the drivers, he lay down in the wagon on the cushions. 
train_hindifullfemale_01397| Soon he was fast asleep, because he had not slept for many nights, and the light had been so strong in the daytime that he had not slept well then. 
train_hindifullfemale_01398| All night long the oxen went on. 
train_hindifullfemale_01399| Near daybreak, the pilot awoke and looked at the last stars fading in the light. 
train_hindifullfemale_01400| Halt, he called to the drivers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01401| We are in the same place where we were yesterday. 
train_hindifullfemale_01402| The oxen must have turned about while I slept. 
train_hindifullfemale_01403| They unyoked the oxen, but there was no water for them to drink. 
train_hindifullfemale_01404| They had thrown away the water that was left the night before. 
train_hindifullfemale_01405| So the men spread the awning over the carts, and the oxen lay down, tired and thirsty. 
train_hindifullfemale_01406| The men, too, lay down saying, The wood and water are gone. we are lost. 
train_hindifullfemale_01407| But the merchant said to himself, This is no time for me to sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_01408| I must find water. The oxen cannot go on if they do not have water to drink. 
train_hindifullfemale_01409| The men must have water. They cannot cook the rice unless they have water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01410| If I give up, we shall all be lost! 
train_hindifullfemale_01411| On and on he walked, keeping close watch of the ground. 
train_hindifullfemale_01412| At last he saw a tuft of grass. 
train_hindifullfemale_01413| There must be water somewhere below, or that grass would not be there, he said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01414| He ran back, shouting to the men, Bring the spade and the hammer! 
train_hindifullfemale_01415| They jumped up, and ran with him to the spot where the grass grew. 
train_hindifullfemale_01416| They began to dig, and by and by they struck a rock and could dig no further. 
train_hindifullfemale_01417| Then the merchant jumped down into the hole they had dug, and put his ear to the rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_01418| I hear water running under this rock, he called to them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01419| We must not give up! Then the merchant came up out of the hole and said to a serving lad, My boy, if you give up we are lost! You go down and try! 
train_hindifullfemale_01420| The boy stood up straight and raised the hammer high above his head and hit the rock as hard as ever he could. 
train_hindifullfemale_01421| He would not give in. They must be saved. 
train_hindifullfemale_01422| Down came the hammer. This time the rock broke. 
train_hindifullfemale_01423| And the boy had hardly time to get out of the well before it was full of cool water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01424| The men drank as if they never could get enough, and then they watered the oxen, and bathed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01425| Then they split up their extra yokes and axles, and built a fire, and cooked their rice. 
train_hindifullfemale_01426| Feeling better, they rested through the day. 
train_hindifullfemale_01427| They set up a flag on the well for travellers to see. 
train_hindifullfemale_01428| At sundown, they started on again, and the next morning reached the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_01429| They sold the goods, and then returned home. 
train_hindifullfemale_01430| Once upon a time many quails lived together in a forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01431| The wisest of them all was their leader. 
train_hindifullfemale_01432| A man lived near the forest and earned his living by catching quails and selling them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01433| Day after day he listened to the note of the leader calling the quails. 
train_hindifullfemale_01434| By and by this man, the fowler, was able to call the quails together. 
train_hindifullfemale_01435| Hearing the note the quails thought it was their leader who called. 
train_hindifullfemale_01436| When they were crowded together, the fowler threw his net over them and off he went into the town. 
train_hindifullfemale_01437| He soon sold all the quails that he had caught. 
train_hindifullfemale_01438| The wise leader saw the plan of the fowler for catching the quails. 
train_hindifullfemale_01439| He called the birds to him and said, This fowler is carrying away so many of us, we must put a stop to it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01440| I have thought of a plan, it is this. 
train_hindifullfemale_01441| The next time the fowler throws a net over you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01442| Each of you must put your head through one of the little holes in the net. 
train_hindifullfemale_01443| Then all of you together must fly away to the nearest thorn bush. 
train_hindifullfemale_01444| You can leave the net on the thorn bush and be free yourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_01445| The quails said that was a very good plan. 
train_hindifullfemale_01446| They would try it the next time the fowler threw the net over them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01447| The very next day the fowler came and called them together. 
train_hindifullfemale_01448| Then he threw the net over them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01449| The quails lifted the net and flew away with it to the nearest thorn bush where they left it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01450| They flew back to their leader to tell him how well his plan had worked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01451| The fowler was busy until evening getting his net off the thorns and he went home empty handed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01452| The next day the same thing happened, and the next. 
train_hindifullfemale_01453| His wife was angry because he did not bring home any money, but the fowler said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01454| The fact is those quails are working together now. 
train_hindifullfemale_01455| The moment my net is over them, off they fly with it, leaving it on a thorn bush. 
train_hindifullfemale_01456| As soon as the quails begin to quarrel I shall be able to catch them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01457| Not long after this, one of the quails in alighting on their feeding ground, trod by accident on another's head. 
train_hindifullfemale_01458| Who trod on my head? angrily cried the second. 
train_hindifullfemale_01459| I did; but I did not mean to. do not be angry, said the first quail. 
train_hindifullfemale_01460| But the second quail was angry and said mean things. 
train_hindifullfemale_01461| Soon all the quails had taken sides in this quarrel. 
train_hindifullfemale_01462| When the fowler came that day he flung his net over them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01463| This time instead of flying off with it, the quails quarrelled. 
train_hindifullfemale_01464| While they were quarrelling the fowler caught them all in his net. 
train_hindifullfemale_01465| He took them to town and sold them for a good price. 
train_hindifullfemale_01466| At one time a dishonest king had a man called the valuer in his court. 
train_hindifullfemale_01467| The valuer set the price which ought to be paid for horses and elephants and the other animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_01468| He also set the price on jewellery and gold, and things of that kind. 
train_hindifullfemale_01469| This man was honest and just, and set the proper price to be paid to the owners of the goods. 
train_hindifullfemale_01470| The king was not pleased with this valuer, because he was honest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01471| If I had another sort of a man as valuer, I might gain more riches, he thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_01472| One day, the king saw a stupid miserly peasant come into the palace yard. 
train_hindifullfemale_01473| The king sent for the fellow and asked him if he would like to be the valuer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01474| The peasant said he would like the position. 
train_hindifullfemale_01475| So the king had him made valuer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01476| He sent the honest valuer away from the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_01477| Then the peasant began to set the prices on horses and elephants, upon gold and jewels. 
train_hindifullfemale_01478| He did not know their value, so he would say anything he chose. 
train_hindifullfemale_01479| As the king had made him valuer, the people had to sell their goods for the price he set. 
train_hindifullfemale_01480| By and by a horse dealer brought five hundred horses to the court of this king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01481| The valuer came and said they were worth a mere measure of rice. 
train_hindifullfemale_01482| So the king ordered the horse dealer to be given the measure of rice, and the horses to be put in the palace stables. 
train_hindifullfemale_01483| The horse dealer went then to see the honest man who had been the valuer, and told him what had happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_01484| What shall I do? asked the horse dealer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01485| I think you can give a present to the valuer which will make him do what you say said the man. 
train_hindifullfemale_01486| Go to him and give him a fine present, then say to him, You said the horses are worth a measure of rice, but now tell what a measure of rice is worth! 
train_hindifullfemale_01487| Can you value that standing in your place by the king? 
train_hindifullfemale_01488| If he says he can, go with him to the king, and I will be there, too. 
train_hindifullfemale_01489| The horse dealer thought this was a good idea. 
train_hindifullfemale_01490| So he took a fine present to the valuer, and said what the other man had told him to say. 
train_hindifullfemale_01491| The valuer took the present. 
train_hindifullfemale_01492| He said, Yes, I can go before the king with you and tell what a measure of rice is worth, I can value that now. 
train_hindifullfemale_01493| Well, let us go at once, said the horse dealer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01494| So they went before the king and his ministers in the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_01495| The horse dealer bowed down before the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01496| He said, O King, I have learned that a measure of rice is the value of my five hundred horses. 
train_hindifullfemale_01497| But will the king be pleased to ask the valuer what is the value of the measure of rice? 
train_hindifullfemale_01498| The king, not knowing what had happened, asked, How now, valuer, what are five hundred horses worth?. 
train_hindifullfemale_01499| A measure of rice, O King! said he. 
train_hindifullfemale_01500| Very good, then! If five hundred horses are worth a measure of rice, what is the measure of rice worth? 
train_hindifullfemale_01501| The measure of rice is worth your whole city, replied the foolish fellow. 
train_hindifullfemale_01502| The ministers clapped their hands, laughing. 
train_hindifullfemale_01503| What a foolish valuer! How can such a man hold that office? 
train_hindifullfemale_01504| We used to think this great city was beyond price, but this man says it is worth only a measure of rice. 
train_hindifullfemale_01505| Then the king was ashamed, and drove out the foolish fellow. 
train_hindifullfemale_01506| I tried to please the king by setting a low price on the horses, and now see what has happened to me! said the valuer, as he ran away from the laughing crowd. 
train_hindifullfemale_01507| Once upon a time, a Rabbit was asleep under a palm tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_01508| All at once he woke up, and thought, What if the world should break up! What then would become of me? 
train_hindifullfemale_01509| At that moment, some monkey dropped a coconut. 
train_hindifullfemale_01510| It fell down on the ground just behind the Rabbit. 
train_hindifullfemale_01511| Hearing the noise, the Rabbit said to himself, The earth is all breaking up! 
train_hindifullfemale_01512| And he jumped up and ran just as fast as he could, without even looking back to see what made the noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_01513| Another Rabbit saw him running, and called after him, What are you running so fast for? 
train_hindifullfemale_01514| Do not ask me! he cried. 
train_hindifullfemale_01515| But the other Rabbit ran after him, begging to know what was the matter. 
train_hindifullfemale_01516| Then the first Rabbit said, do you not know? 
train_hindifullfemale_01517| The earth is all breaking up. And on he ran, and the second Rabbit ran with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01518| The next Rabbit they met ran with them when he heard that the earth was all breaking up. 
train_hindifullfemale_01519| One Rabbit after another joined them, until there were hundreds of Rabbits running as fast as they could go. 
train_hindifullfemale_01520| They passed a Deer, calling out to him that the earth was all breaking up and the Deer then ran with them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01521| The Deer called to a Fox to come along because the earth was all breaking up. 
train_hindifullfemale_01522| At last the Lion saw the animals running, and heard their cry that the earth was all breaking up. 
train_hindifullfemale_01523| He thought there must be some mistake, so he ran to the foot of a hill in front of them and roared three times. 
train_hindifullfemale_01524| This stopped them, for they knew the voice of the King of Beasts, and they feared him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01525| Why are you running so fast? asked the Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_01526| King Lion, they answered him, the earth is all breaking up! 
train_hindifullfemale_01527| Who saw it breaking up, asked the Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_01528| I did not, said the Elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01529| Ask the Fox, he told me about it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01530| I did not, said the Fox. 
train_hindifullfemale_01531| The Rabbits told me about it, said the Deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01532| One after another of the Rabbits said, I did not see it, but another Rabbit told me about it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01533| At last the Lion came to the Rabbit who had first said the earth was all breaking up. 
train_hindifullfemale_01534| Is it true that the earth is all breaking up? the Lion asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01535| Yes, O Lion, it is, said the Rabbit. 
train_hindifullfemale_01536| I was asleep under a palm tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_01537| I woke up and thought, What would become of me if the earth should all break up? 
train_hindifullfemale_01538| At that very moment, I heard the sound of the earth breaking up, and I ran away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01539| Then, said the Lion, you and I will go back to the place where the earth began to break up, and see what is the matter. 
train_hindifullfemale_01540| So the Lion put the little Rabbit on his back, and away they went like the wind. 
train_hindifullfemale_01541| The other animals waited for them at the foot of the hill. 
train_hindifullfemale_01542| The Rabbit told the Lion when they were near the place where he slept, and the Lion saw just where the Rabbit had been sleeping. 
train_hindifullfemale_01543| He saw, too, the coconut that had fallen to the ground near by. 
train_hindifullfemale_01544| Then the Lion said to the Rabbit, It must have been the sound of the coconut falling to the ground that you heard you foolish Rabbit! 
train_hindifullfemale_01545| And the Lion ran back to other animals, and told them all about it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01546| If it had not been for the wise King of Beasts, they might still be running. 
train_hindifullfemale_01547| Once upon a time in a certain country a thrifty merchant visited a great city and bought a great supply of goods. 
train_hindifullfemale_01548| He loaded wagons with the goods, which he was going to sell as he travelled through the country. 
train_hindifullfemale_01549| A stupid young merchant was buying goods in the same city. 
train_hindifullfemale_01550| He too was going to sell what he bought as he travelled through the country. 
train_hindifullfemale_01551| They were both ready to start at the same time. 
train_hindifullfemale_01552| The thrifty merchant thought, We cannot travel together, for the men will find it hard to get wood and water, and there will not be enough grass for so many oxen. 
train_hindifullfemale_01553| Either he or I ought to go first. 
train_hindifullfemale_01554| So he went to the young man and told him this, saying, Will you go before or come on after me? 
train_hindifullfemale_01555| The other one thought, It will be better for me to go first. 
train_hindifullfemale_01556| I shall then travel on a road that is not cut up. 
train_hindifullfemale_01557| The oxen will eat grass that has not been touched. 
train_hindifullfemale_01558| The water will be clean. Also, I shall sell my goods at what price I like. 
train_hindifullfemale_01559| So he said, Friend, I will go on first. 
train_hindifullfemale_01560| This answer pleased the thrifty merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01561| He said to himself, Those who go before will make the rough places smooth. 
train_hindifullfemale_01562| The old rank grass will have been eaten by the oxen that have gone before, while my oxen will eat the freshly grown tender shoots. 
train_hindifullfemale_01563| Those who go before will dig wells from which we shall drink. 
train_hindifullfemale_01564| Then, too, I will not have to bother about setting prices, but I can sell my goods at the prices set by the other man. 
train_hindifullfemale_01565| So he said aloud, Very well friend, you may go on first. 
train_hindifullfemale_01566| At once the foolish merchant started on his journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_01567| Soon he had left the city and was in the country. 
train_hindifullfemale_01568| By and by he came to a desert which he had to cross. 
train_hindifullfemale_01569| So he filled great water jars with water, loaded them into a large wagon and started across the desert. 
train_hindifullfemale_01570| Now on the sands of this desert there lived a wicked demon. 
train_hindifullfemale_01571| This demon saw the foolish young merchant coming and thought to himself, if I can make him empty those water jars, soon I shall be able to overcome him and have him in my power. 
train_hindifullfemale_01572| So the demon went further along the road and changed himself into the likeness of a noble gentleman. 
train_hindifullfemale_01573| He called up a beautiful carriage, drawn by milk white oxen. 
train_hindifullfemale_01574| Then he called ten other demons, dressed them like men and armed them with bows and arrows, swords and shields. 
train_hindifullfemale_01575| Seated in his carriage, followed by the ten demons, he rode back to meet the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01576| He put mud on the carriage wheels, hung water lilies and wet grasses upon the oxen and the carriage. 
train_hindifullfemale_01577| Then he made the clothes the demons wore and their hair all wet. 
train_hindifullfemale_01578| Drops of water trickled down over their faces just as if they had all come through a stream. 
train_hindifullfemale_01579| As the demons neared the foolish merchant they turned their carriage to one side of the way, saying pleasantly, Where are you going? 
train_hindifullfemale_01580| The merchant replied, We have come from the great city back there and are going across the desert to the villages beyond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01581| You come dripping with mud and carrying water lilies and grasses. 
train_hindifullfemale_01582| Does it rain on the road you have come by? 
train_hindifullfemale_01583| Did you come through a stream? 
train_hindifullfemale_01584| The demon answered, the dark streak across the sky is a forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01585| In it there are ponds full of water lilies and the rains come often. 
train_hindifullfemale_01586| What have you in all those carts? 
train_hindifullfemale_01587| Goods to be sold, replied the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01588| But in that last big heavy wagon what do you carry? the demon asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01589| Jars full of water for the journey, answered the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01590| The demon said, you have done well to bring water as far as this, but there is no need of it beyond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01591| Empty out all that water and go on easily. 
train_hindifullfemale_01592| Then he added, But we have delayed too long. Drive on! 
train_hindifullfemale_01593| And he drove on until he was out of sight of the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01594| Then he returned to his home with his followers to wait for the night to come. 
train_hindifullfemale_01595| The foolish merchant did as the demon told him and emptied every jar, saving not even a cupful. 
train_hindifullfemale_01596| On and on they traveled and the streak on the sky faded with the sunset. 
train_hindifullfemale_01597| There was no forest, the dark line being only clouds. 
train_hindifullfemale_01598| No water was to be found. 
train_hindifullfemale_01599| The men had no water to drink and no food to eat, for they had no water in which to cook their rice. 
train_hindifullfemale_01600| They went thirsty and went supper less to bed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01601| The oxen too, were hungry and thirsty and dropped down to sleep here and there. 
train_hindifullfemale_01602| Late at night the demons fell upon them and easily carried off every man. 
train_hindifullfemale_01603| They drove the oxen on ahead of them, but the loaded carts they did not care to take away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01604| A month and a half after this the wise merchant followed over the same road. 
train_hindifullfemale_01605| He too, was met on the desert by the demon just as the other had been. 
train_hindifullfemale_01606| But the wise man knew the man was a demon because he cast no shadow. 
train_hindifullfemale_01607| The demon told him of the ponds in the forest ahead and advised him to throw away the water jars. 
train_hindifullfemale_01608| The wise merchant replied, we do not throw away the water we have until we get to a place where we see there is more. 
train_hindifullfemale_01609| Then the demon drove on. But the men who were with the merchant protested against it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01610| Stopping all the carts the wise merchant asked the men, have you ever heard any one say that there was a lake or a pond in this desert? 
train_hindifullfemale_01611| You have lived near here always. 
train_hindifullfemale_01612| We never heard of a pond or lake, they said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01613| Does any man feel a wind laden with dampness blowing against him? he asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01614| No sir, they answered. 
train_hindifullfemale_01615| Can you see a rain cloud, any of you? 
train_hindifullfemale_01616| No sir, not one, they said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01617| Those fellows were not men, they were demons! said the wise merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01618| They must have come out to make us throw away the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01619| Then when we were faint and weak they might have put an end to us. 
train_hindifullfemale_01620| Go on at once and do not throw away a single half pint of water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01621| So they drove on and before nightfall they came upon the loaded wagons belonging to the foolish merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01622| Then the thrifty merchant had his wagons drawn up in a circle. 
train_hindifullfemale_01623| In the middle of the circle he had the oxen lie down, and also some of the men. 
train_hindifullfemale_01624| He himself with the head men stood on guard, swords in hand and waited for the demons. 
train_hindifullfemale_01625| But the demons did not bother them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01626| Early the next day the thrifty merchant took the best of the wagons left by the foolish merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01627| He went on safely to the city across the desert. 
train_hindifullfemale_01628| There he sold all the goods at a profit and returned with his company to his own city. 
train_hindifullfemale_01629| Once upon a time a king had an Elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01630| The Elephant was so gentle and good and looked so kind. 
train_hindifullfemale_01631| He never hurts anybody, the keeper of the Elephants often said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01632| Now one night some robbers came into the courtyard and sat on the ground just outside the stall where the elephant slept. 
train_hindifullfemale_01633| The talk of the robbers awoke girly face. 
train_hindifullfemale_01634| This is the way to break into a house, they said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01635| Once inside the house kill any one who wakens. 
train_hindifullfemale_01636| A robber must not be afraid to kill. 
train_hindifullfemale_01637| A robber must be cruel and have no pity. 
train_hindifullfemale_01638| He must never be good, even for a moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_01639| The elephant said to himself, those men are teaching me how I should act. 
train_hindifullfemale_01640| I will be cruel and I will show no pity. 
train_hindifullfemale_01641| I will not be good. Not even for a moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_01642| The next morning the keeper came to feed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01643| He picked him up in his trunk and threw the poor keeper to the ground, killing him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01644| Another keeper ran to see what the trouble was, and the elephant killed him too. 
train_hindifullfemale_01645| For days and days, the elephant was so ugly that no one dared to go near. 
train_hindifullfemale_01646| The food was left for him, but no man would go near him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01647| By and by the king heard of this and sent one of his wise men to find out what happened to the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01648| The wise man had known the elephant a long time. 
train_hindifullfemale_01649| He looked the Elephant over carefully and could find nothing that seemed to be the matter. 
train_hindifullfemale_01650| He thought at last, the elephant must have heard some bad men talking. 
train_hindifullfemale_01651| Have there been any bad men talking about here? asked the wise man. 
train_hindifullfemale_01652| Yes, one of the keepers said, a band of robbers were caught here a few weeks ago. 
train_hindifullfemale_01653| They had met in the yard to talk over their plans. 
train_hindifullfemale_01654| They were talking together near the stall where the elephant sleeps. 
train_hindifullfemale_01655| So the wise man went back to the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01656| He said, I think the elephant has been listening to bad talk. 
train_hindifullfemale_01657| Send some good men to talk where the elephant can hear them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01658| I think he will be a good Elephant once more. 
train_hindifullfemale_01659| So that night the king sent a company of the best men to be found to sit and talk near the stall where the elephant lived 
train_hindifullfemale_01660| They said to one another, It is wrong to hurt any one. 
train_hindifullfemale_01661| It is wrong to kill, every one should be gentle and good. 
train_hindifullfemale_01662| Now those men are teaching me, thought the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_01663| I must be gentle and good, i must hurt no one and i must not kill any one. 
train_hindifullfemale_01664| And from that time on the elephant was tame and as good as ever an Elephant could be. 
train_hindifullfemale_01665| There was once a Deer the colour of gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_01666| His eyes were like round jewels, his horns were white as silver. 
train_hindifullfemale_01667| His mouth was red like a flower, his hoofs were bright and hard. 
train_hindifullfemale_01668| He had a large body and a fine tail. 
train_hindifullfemale_01669| He lived in a forest and was king of a herd of five hundred Banyan Deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01670| Near by lived another herd of Deer, called the monkey Deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01671| They too had a king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01672| The king of that country was fond of hunting the Deer and eating deer meat. 
train_hindifullfemale_01673| He did not like to go alone so he called the people of his town to go with him, day after day. 
train_hindifullfemale_01674| The towns people did not like this for a while, they were gone, no one did their work. 
train_hindifullfemale_01675| So they decided to make a park and drive the Deer into it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01676| Then the king could go into the park and hunt and they could go on with their daily work. 
train_hindifullfemale_01677| They made a park, planted grass in it and provided water for the Deer, built a fence all around it and drove the Deer into it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01678| Then they shut the gate and went to the king to tell him that in the park near by he could find all the Deer he wanted. 
train_hindifullfemale_01679| The king went at once to look at the Deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01680| First he saw there the two Deer kings, and granted them their lives. 
train_hindifullfemale_01681| Then he looked at their great herds. 
train_hindifullfemale_01682| Some days the king would go to hunt the Deer, sometimes his cook would go. 
train_hindifullfemale_01683| As soon as any of the Deer saw them they would shake with fear and run. 
train_hindifullfemale_01684| But when they had been hit once or twice they would drop down dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_01685| The King of the Banyan Deer sent for the King of the monkey Deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01686| He said, Friend, many of the Deer are being killed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01687| Many are wounded besides those who are killed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01688| After this suppose one from my herd goes up to be killed one day, and the next day let one from your herd go up. 
train_hindifullfemale_01689| Fewer Deer will be lost this way. The monkey Deer agreed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01690| Each day the Deer whose turn it was would go and lie down, placing its head on the block. 
train_hindifullfemale_01691| The cook would come and carry off the one he found lying there. 
train_hindifullfemale_01692| One day the lot fell to a mother Deer who had a young baby, She went to her king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01693| She said, O King of the monkeyDeer, let the turn pass me by until my baby is old enough to get along without me. 
train_hindifullfemale_01694| Then I will go and put my head on the block. 
train_hindifullfemale_01695| But the king did not help her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01696| He told her that if the lot had fallen to her she must die. 
train_hindifullfemale_01697| Then she went to the King of the Banyan Deer and asked him to save her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01698| Go back to your herd. 
train_hindifullfemale_01699| I will go in your place, said he. 
train_hindifullfemale_01700| The next day the cook found the King of the Banyan Deer lying with his head on the block. 
train_hindifullfemale_01701| The cook went to the king, who came himself to find out about this. 
train_hindifullfemale_01702| King of the Banyan Deer! did I not grant you your life? 
train_hindifullfemale_01703| Why are you lying here? 
train_hindifullfemale_01704| The King of the Banyan Deer said to the king, Great king, a mother came with her young baby and told me that the lot had fallen to her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01705| I could not ask any one else to take her place, so I came myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_01706| King of the Banyan Deer! I never saw such kindness and mercy! Rise up! 
train_hindifullfemale_01707| I grant your life and hers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01708| Nor will I hunt any more the Deer in either park or forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01709| Once upon a time a king had three sons. 
train_hindifullfemale_01710| The first was called Prince of the Stars. 
train_hindifullfemale_01711| The next was called the Moon Prince and the third was called the Sun Prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_01712| The king was so very happy when the third son was born that he promised to give the queen any boon she might ask. 
train_hindifullfemale_01713| The queen kept the promise in mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_01714| Waiting until the third son was grown before asking the king to give her the boon. 
train_hindifullfemale_01715| On the twenty first birthday of the Sun Prince she said to the king, Great King, when our youngest child was born you said you would give me a boon. 
train_hindifullfemale_01716| Now I ask you to give the kingdom to Sun Prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_01717| But the king refused, saying that the kingdom must go to the oldest son. 
train_hindifullfemale_01718| It belongs by right to him, next it would belong by right to the second son. 
train_hindifullfemale_01719| Not until they were both dead could the kingdom go to the third son. 
train_hindifullfemale_01720| The queen went away, but the king saw that she was not pleased with his answer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01721| He feared that she would do harm to the older princes to get them out of the way of the Sun Prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_01722| So he called his elder sons and told them that they must go and live in the forest until his death. 
train_hindifullfemale_01723| Then come back and reign in the city that is yours by right, he said. 
train_hindifullfemale_01724| And with tears he kissed them on the foreheads and sent them away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01725| As they were going down out of the palace, the Sun Prince asked them where they were going. 
train_hindifullfemale_01726| And when he heard where they were going and why, he said, i will go with you, my brothers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01727| So off they started, they went on and on and by and by they reached the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01728| There they sat down to rest in the shade of a pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01729| Then the eldest brother said to Sun Prince, Go down to the pond and bathe and drink. 
train_hindifullfemale_01730| Then bring us a drink while we rest here. 
train_hindifullfemale_01731| Now the King of the Fairies had given this pond to a water sprite. 
train_hindifullfemale_01732| The Fairy King had said to the water sprite, You are to have in your power all who go down into the water except those who give the right answer to one question. 
train_hindifullfemale_01733| Those who give the right answer will not be in your power. 
train_hindifullfemale_01734| The question is, what are the Good Fairies like? 
train_hindifullfemale_01735| When the Sun Prince went into the pond the water sprite saw him and asked him the question. 
train_hindifullfemale_01736| They are like the sun and the moon, said the sun Prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_01737| You do not know what the Good Fairies are like, cried the water sprite. 
train_hindifullfemale_01738| He carried the poor boy down into her cave. 
train_hindifullfemale_01739| By and by the eldest brother said, Moon Prince, go down and see why our brother stays so long in the pond! 
train_hindifullfemale_01740| As soon as the Moon Prince reached the water's edge the water sprite called to him and asked him the question. 
train_hindifullfemale_01741| Like the sky above us, replied the Moon Prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_01742| You do not know, either, said the water sprite 
train_hindifullfemale_01743| He then dragged the Moon Prince down into the cave where the Sun Prince sat. 
train_hindifullfemale_01744| Something must have happened to those two brothers of mine, thought the eldest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01745| So he went to the pond and saw the marks of the footsteps where his brothers had gone down into the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01746| Then he knew that a water sprite must live in that pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01747| He girded on his sword, and stood with his bow in his hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_01748| The water sprite soon came along in the form of a woodsman. 
train_hindifullfemale_01749| You seem tired, Friend, he said to the prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_01750| Why do not you bathe in the lake and then lie on the bank and rest? 
train_hindifullfemale_01751| But the prince knew, that it was a water sprite, and he said, You have carried off my brothers! 
train_hindifullfemale_01752| Yes, said the water sprite. 
train_hindifullfemale_01753| Price questioned the sprite, Why did you carry them off? 
train_hindifullfemale_01754| Because they did not answer my question, said the water sprite. 
train_hindifullfemale_01755| I have power over all who go down into the water except those who do give the right answer. 
train_hindifullfemale_01756| I will answer your question, said the eldest brother, and he did. 
train_hindifullfemale_01757| The Good Fairies are like The pure in heart who fear to sin, The good, kindly in word and deed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01758| O Wise Prince, I will bring back to you one of your brothers, Which shall I bring? said the water sprite. 
train_hindifullfemale_01759| Bring me the younger one, said the prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_01760| It was on his account that our father sent us away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01761| I could never go away with Moon Prince and leave poor Sun Prince here. 
train_hindifullfemale_01762| O Wise Prince, you know what the good should do and you are kind. 
train_hindifullfemale_01763| I will bring back both your brothers, said the water sprite. 
train_hindifullfemale_01764| After that the three princes lived together in the forest until the king died. 
train_hindifullfemale_01765| Then they went back to the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_01766| The eldest brother was made king and he had his brothers rule with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01767| He also built a home for the water sprite in the palace grounds. 
train_hindifullfemale_01768| Once upon a time a number of carpenters lived on a river bank near a large forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01769| Every day the carpenters went in boats to the forest to cut down the trees and make them into lumber. 
train_hindifullfemale_01770| One day while they were at work an Elephant came limping on three feet to them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01771| He held up one foot and the carpenters saw that it was swollen and sore. 
train_hindifullfemale_01772| Then the Elephant lay down and the men saw that there was a great splinter in the sore foot. 
train_hindifullfemale_01773| They pulled it out and washed the sore carefully so that in a short time it would be well again. 
train_hindifullfemale_01774| Thankful for the cure, the Elephant thought, These carpenters have done so much for me, I must be useful to them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01775| So after that the Elephant used to pull up trees for the carpenters. 
train_hindifullfemale_01776| Sometimes when the trees were chopped down he would roll the logs down to the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_01777| Other times he brought their tools for them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01778| And the carpenters used to feed them well morning, noon and night. 
train_hindifullfemale_01779| Now this Elephant had a son who was white all over, a beautiful, strong young one. 
train_hindifullfemale_01780| The old Elephant said to himself, I will take my son to the place in the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_01781| I go to work there each day so that he may learn to help the carpenters, for I am no longer young and strong. 
train_hindifullfemale_01782| So the old Elephant told his son how the carpenters had taken good care of him when he was badly hurt and took him to them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01783| The white Elephant did as his father told him to do and helped the carpenters and they fed him well. 
train_hindifullfemale_01784| When the work was done at night the young Elephant went to play in the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_01785| The carpenters' children played with him, in the water and on the bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_01786| He liked to pick them up in his trunk and set them on the high branches of the trees and then let them climb down on his back. 
train_hindifullfemale_01787| One day the king came down the river and saw this beautiful white Elephant working for the carpenters. 
train_hindifullfemale_01788| The king at once wanted the Elephant for his own and paid the carpenters a great price for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01789| Then with a last look at his playmates, the children, the beautiful white Elephant went on with the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01790| The king was proud of his new Elephant and took the best care of him as long as he lived. 
train_hindifullfemale_01791| Once upon a time there was an Ox named Big Red. 
train_hindifullfemale_01792| He had a younger brother named Little Red. 
train_hindifullfemale_01793| These two brothers did all the carting on a large farm. 
train_hindifullfemale_01794| Now the farmer had an only daughter and she was soon to be married. 
train_hindifullfemale_01795| Her mother gave orders that the Pig should be fattened for the wedding feast. 
train_hindifullfemale_01796| Little Red noticed that the Pig was fed on choice food. 
train_hindifullfemale_01797| He said to his brother, How is it, Big Red, that you and I are given only straw and grass to eat, We do all the hard work on the farm? 
train_hindifullfemale_01798| That lazy Pig does nothing but eat the choice food the farmer gives him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01799| Said his brother, My dear Little Red, do not envy him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01800| That little Pig is eating the food of death! 
train_hindifullfemale_01801| He is being fattened for the wedding feast. 
train_hindifullfemale_01802| Eat your straw and grass and be content and live long. 
train_hindifullfemale_01803| Not long afterwards the fattened Pig was killed and cooked for the wedding feast. 
train_hindifullfemale_01804| Then Big Red said, Did you see, Little Red, what became of the Pig after all his fine feeding? 
train_hindifullfemale_01805| Yes, said the little brother, we can go on eating plain food for years. 
train_hindifullfemale_01806| The poor little Pig ate the food of death and now he is dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_01807| His feed was good while it lasted, but it did not last long. 
train_hindifullfemale_01808| Once upon a time a rich man gave a baby Elephant to a woman. 
train_hindifullfemale_01809| She took the best of care of this great baby and soon became very fond of him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01810| The children in the village called her Granny, and they called the Elephant Granny's Blackie. 
train_hindifullfemale_01811| The Elephant carried the children on his back all over the village. 
train_hindifullfemale_01812| They shared their goodies with him and he played with them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01813| Please, Blackie, give us a swing, they said to him almost every day. 
train_hindifullfemale_01814| Come on! Who is first? Blackie answered and picked them up with his trunk, swung them high in the air. 
train_hindifullfemale_01815| Then he put them down again, carefully. 
train_hindifullfemale_01816| But Blackie never did any work. 
train_hindifullfemale_01817| He ate and slept, played with the children, and visited Granny. 
train_hindifullfemale_01818| One day Blackie wanted Granny to go off to the woods with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01819| I can't go, Blackie, dear. I have too much work to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_01820| Then Blackie looked at her and saw that she was growing old and feeble. 
train_hindifullfemale_01821| I am young and strong, he thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_01822| I will see if I can find some work to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_01823| If I could bring some money home to her, she would not have to work so hard. 
train_hindifullfemale_01824| So next morning, bright and early, he started down to the river bank. 
train_hindifullfemale_01825| There he found a man who was in great trouble. 
train_hindifullfemale_01826| There was a long line of wagons so heavily loaded that the oxen could not draw them through the shallow water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01827| When the man saw Blackie standing on the bank he asked, Who owns this Elephant? 
train_hindifullfemale_01828| I want to hire him to help my Oxen pull these wagons across the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_01829| A child standing near by said, That is Granny's Blackie. 
train_hindifullfemale_01830| Very well, said the man, I will pay two pieces of silver for each wagon this Elephant draws across the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_01831| Blackie was glad to hear this promise. 
train_hindifullfemale_01832| He went into the river, and drew one wagon after another across to the other side. 
train_hindifullfemale_01833| Then he went up to the man for the money. 
train_hindifullfemale_01834| The man counted out one piece of silver for each wagon. 
train_hindifullfemale_01835| When Blackie saw that the man had counted out but one piece of silver for each wagon, instead of two, he would not touch the money at all. 
train_hindifullfemale_01836| He stood in the road and would not let the wagons pass him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01837| The man tried to get Blackie out of the way, but not one step would he move. 
train_hindifullfemale_01838| Then the man went back and counted out another piece of silver for each of the wagons and put the silver in a bag tied around Blackie's neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_01839| Then Blackie started for home, proud to think that he had a present for Granny. 
train_hindifullfemale_01840| The children had missed Blackie and had asked Granny where he was, but she said she did not know where he had gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_01841| They all looked for him, but it was nearly night, before they heard him coming. 
train_hindifullfemale_01842| Where have you been, Blackie? And what is that around your neck, the children cried, running to meet their playmate. 
train_hindifullfemale_01843| But Blackie would not stop to talk with his playmates. 
train_hindifullfemale_01844| He ran straight home to Granny. 
train_hindifullfemale_01845| Oh, Blackie! she said, Where have you been? 
train_hindifullfemale_01846| What is in that bag? And she took the bag off his neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_01847| Blackie told her that he had earned some money for her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01848| Oh, Blackie, Blackie, said Granny, how hard you must have worked to earn these pieces of silver! What a good Blackie you are! 
train_hindifullfemale_01849| And after that Blackie did all the hard work and Granny rested, and they were both very happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_01850| Long Ago there was a summer when very little rain fell. 
train_hindifullfemale_01851| All the Animals suffered for want of water, but the Fishes suffered most of all. 
train_hindifullfemale_01852| In one pond full of Fishes, the water was very low indeed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01853| A Crane sat on the bank watching the Fishes. 
train_hindifullfemale_01854| What are you doing? asked a little Fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01855| I am thinking about you Fishes there in the pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01856| It is so nearly dry, answered the Crane. 
train_hindifullfemale_01857| Yes, the Crane went on, I was wishing I might do something for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01858| I know of a pond in the deep woods where there is plenty of water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01859| I declare, said the little Fish, you are the first Crane that ever offered to help a Fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01860| That may be, said the Crane, but the water is so low in your pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01861| I could easily carry you one by one on my back to that other pond 
train_hindifullfemale_01862| There is plenty of water, food and cool shade there. 
train_hindifullfemale_01863| I do not believe there is any such pond, said the little Fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01864| What you wish to do is to eat us, one by one. 
train_hindifullfemale_01865| If you do not believe me, said the Crane, send with me one of the Fishes whom you can believe. 
train_hindifullfemale_01866| I will show him the pond and bring him back to tell you all about it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01867| A big Fish heard the Crane. 
train_hindifullfemale_01868| He said, I will go with you to see the pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01869| I may as well be eaten by the Crane as to die here. 
train_hindifullfemale_01870| So the Crane put the big Fish on his back and started for the deep woods. 
train_hindifullfemale_01871| Soon the Crane showed the big Fish the pool of water. 
train_hindifullfemale_01872| See how cool and shady it is here, he said, and how much larger the pond is, and how full it is! 
train_hindifullfemale_01873| Yes! said the big Fish, take me back to the little pond and I will tell the other Fishes all about it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01874| So back they went. The Fishes all wanted to go when they heard the big Fish talk about the fine pond which he had seen. 
train_hindifullfemale_01875| Then the Crane picked up another Fish and carried it away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01876| Not to the pool, but into the woods where the other Fishes could not see them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01877| Then the Crane put the Fish down and ate it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01878| The Crane went back for another Fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01879| He carried it to the same place in the woods and ate it, too. 
train_hindifullfemale_01880| This he did until he had eaten all the Fishes in the pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01881| The next day the Crane went to the pond to see if he had left a Fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_01882| There was not one left, but there was a Crab on the sand. 
train_hindifullfemale_01883| Little Crab, would you let me take you to the fine pond in the deep woods where I took the Fishes? asked the crane. 
train_hindifullfemale_01884| But how could you carry me? asked the Crab. 
train_hindifullfemale_01885| Oh, easily, answered the Crane. 
train_hindifullfemale_01886| I will take you on my back as I did the Fishes. 
train_hindifullfemale_01887| No, I thank you, said the Crab, I can't go that way. 
train_hindifullfemale_01888| I am afraid you might drop me. 
train_hindifullfemale_01889| If I could take hold of your neck with my claws, I would go. 
train_hindifullfemale_01890| You know we Crabs have a tight grip. 
train_hindifullfemale_01891| The Crane knew about the tight grip of the Crabs, and he did not like to have the Crab hold on with his claws. 
train_hindifullfemale_01892| But he was hungry, so he said, Very well, hold tight. 
train_hindifullfemale_01893| And off went the Crane with the Crab. 
train_hindifullfemale_01894| When they reached the place where the Crane had eaten the Fishes, the Crane said, I think you can walk the rest of the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_01895| Let go of my neck. I see no pond, said the Crab. 
train_hindifullfemale_01896| All I can see is a pile of Fish bones. 
train_hindifullfemale_01897| Is that all that is left of the Fishes?. 
train_hindifullfemale_01898| Yes, said the Crane, and if you will let go of my neck, your shell will be all that will be left of you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01899| And the Crane put his head down near the ground so that the Crab could get off easily. 
train_hindifullfemale_01900| But the Crab pinched the Crane's neck so that his head fell off. 
train_hindifullfemale_01901| Not my shell, but your bones are left to dry with the bones of the Fishes, said the Crab. 
train_hindifullfemale_01902| Why is it that Crows torment the Owls as they sleep in the daytime? 
train_hindifullfemale_01903| For the same reason that the Owls try to kill the Crows while they sleep at night. 
train_hindifullfemale_01904| Listen to a tale of long ago and then you will see why. 
train_hindifullfemale_01905| Once upon a time, the people who lived together when the world was young took a certain man for their king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01906| The four footed animals also took one of their number for their king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01907| The fish in the ocean chose a king to rule over them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01908| Then the birds gathered together on a great flat rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_01909| One of them said, Among men there is a king, and among the beasts, and the fish have one too; but we birds have none. 
train_hindifullfemale_01910| We ought to have a king, Let us choose one now. 
train_hindifullfemale_01911| And so the birds talked the matter over and at last they all said, Let us have the Owl for our king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01912| No, not all, for one old Crow rose up and said, For my part, I do not want the Owl to be our king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01913| Look at him now while you are all crying that you want him for your king. 
train_hindifullfemale_01914| See how sour he looks right now. 
train_hindifullfemale_01915| If that's the cross look he wears when he is happy, how will he look when he is angry? 
train_hindifullfemale_01916| I, for one, want no such sour looking king! 
train_hindifullfemale_01917| Then the Crow flew up into the air crying, I do not like it! 
train_hindifullfemale_01918| The Owl rose and followed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01919| From that time on the Crows and the Owls have been enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_01920| The birds chose a turtle Dove to be their king, and then flew to their homes. 
train_hindifullfemale_01921| Once upon a time, there was a swan that had striking golden feathers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01922| This swan lived in a pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_01923| There was a house near this pond, where a poor woman lived with her two daughters. 
train_hindifullfemale_01924| The people were really poor and were leading a tough life. 
train_hindifullfemale_01925| The swan found that the poor mother was passing a hard time with her daughters. 
train_hindifullfemale_01926| The swan thought, If I give them one after another of my golden feathers, the mother can sell them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01927| She and her daughters can live in comfort with the money raised from it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01928| After thinking about this, the swan flew away to the poor woman's house. 
train_hindifullfemale_01929| On seeing the swan inside the house, the woman said, Why have you come here? We have nothing to offer you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01930| The Swan replied, I have not come to take anything, but I have something to give you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01931| I know your condition and I will give my golden feathers one by one and you can sell them. 
train_hindifullfemale_01932| With the money raised through it, you people can easily live in comfort. 
train_hindifullfemale_01933| After saying this, the swan shed one of her feathers and then flew away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01934| This became a regular feature and from time to time, the swan came back and every time left another feather. 
train_hindifullfemale_01935| Like this, the mother and her daughters were happily leading their life by selling the feathers of the golden swan. 
train_hindifullfemale_01936| Each golden feather got them enough money to keep them in comfort. 
train_hindifullfemale_01937| But the mother became greedy to get all the feathers as soon as possible. 
train_hindifullfemale_01938| One day, she said to her daughters, 
train_hindifullfemale_01939| Now, we will not trust this swan, possibly she may fly away and never come back. 
train_hindifullfemale_01940| If this would happen, we will be poor again. 
train_hindifullfemale_01941| We will take all of her feathers, when she will come the next time. 
train_hindifullfemale_01942| The innocent daughters replied, Mother, this will hurt the swan. 
train_hindifullfemale_01943| We will not cause any pain to her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01944| But the mother was determined to catch hold the swan the very next time she comes. 
train_hindifullfemale_01945| Next time, when the swan came, the mother caught her and pulled out all of her feathers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01946| Now, the golden feathers of the swan changed into some strange feathers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01947| The mother was shocked to see such feathers. 
train_hindifullfemale_01948| The Golden Swan said, Poor Mother, I wanted to help you, but you wanted to kill me instead. 
train_hindifullfemale_01949| As per my wish, I used to give you the golden feather. 
train_hindifullfemale_01950| Now, I think there is no need to help you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01951| Now, my feathers are nothing more than chicken feathers for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_01952| I am going from this place and will never come back. 
train_hindifullfemale_01953| The mother felt sorry and apologized for the mistake committed by her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01954| The Golden Swan said, Never be greedy, and flew away. 
train_hindifullfemale_01955| From this we can learn a lesson of Excess greed brings nothing. 
train_hindifullfemale_01956| Stories, about Tenali Rama and his practical jokes on everyone around him including distinguished fellow poets and the emperor himself, abound in south India. 
train_hindifullfemale_01957| His fame spread beyond Vijaynagar, to areas that come in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka today. 
train_hindifullfemale_01958| Tenali Rama was also a great scholar of several languages that included Marathi, Tamil and Kannada. 
train_hindifullfemale_01959| King Krishnadeva Rayar had some superior quality brinjal plants growing in his private garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_01960| No one was allowed to view the garden without the king's permission, let alone taste the brinjal. 
train_hindifullfemale_01961| Once the king invited his courtiers to a feast in which the brinjal was served. 
train_hindifullfemale_01962| Tenali Rama enjoyed the vegetable so much that he talked to his wife about it on returning home so much so that she insisted on tasting it. 
train_hindifullfemale_01963| How can I get them for you? Tenali Rama asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_01964| The king is so possessive about the vegetable that he can detect the theft of even one brinjal from his garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_01965| And, I'm sure that he would want the thief's head chopped off right then, if he caught him red handed. 
train_hindifullfemale_01966| But Tenali's wife begged him to allow her to taste the brinjal. 
train_hindifullfemale_01967| Tenali Rama was helpless, and after much deliberation, he agreed to his wife's demand. 
train_hindifullfemale_01968| One night he quietly jumped into the king's garden and plucked a few brinjals from the garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_01969| His wife cooked them with zeal and was all praise for the taste. 
train_hindifullfemale_01970| She wanted to let their six year old son also taste the vegetable, but Tenali Rama asked her not to. 
train_hindifullfemale_01971| Do not make such a mistake, he warned her. 
train_hindifullfemale_01972| If he happens to tell somebody, we will be in deep trouble. 
train_hindifullfemale_01973| But his wife did not agree, and asked How is that possible? 
train_hindifullfemale_01974| How can we eat something whose taste we shall remember forever and not share it with our son! 
train_hindifullfemale_01975| Find a way out so that he gets to taste the vegetable and nobody is able to prove that we stole it from the king's garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_01976| Tenali Rama had no option but to nod his head in agreement. 
train_hindifullfemale_01977| He filled a bucket with water and went upstairs to the roof where his son was sleeping. 
train_hindifullfemale_01978| He poured the water on the child. 
train_hindifullfemale_01979| Then he picked up the child and said, It is raining, Let us go inside the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_01980| Once in, he got the child's clothes changed and gave him the vegetable to eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_01981| He again remarked that it was raining outside, and let the boy sleep in the room. 
train_hindifullfemale_01982| The next day the king came to know of the theft in his garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_01983| The royal gardener who kept a head count of each vegetable and flower, found one brinjal missing. 
train_hindifullfemale_01984| It became the talk of the town. 
train_hindifullfemale_01985| The king declared a huge prize on the thief's head. 
train_hindifullfemale_01986| Chief Minister Appaji suspected that only Tenali Rama was capable of such an audacious act. 
train_hindifullfemale_01987| He let the king know about his suspicion. 
train_hindifullfemale_01988| The king said, I know he is very clever and always gets out of charges on one pretext or the other. 
train_hindifullfemale_01989| It is better that we call his son. 
train_hindifullfemale_01990| We will find the truth through him. 
train_hindifullfemale_01991| Tenali will lie to get out of any situation, but he would never ask the child to do so. 
train_hindifullfemale_01992| Tenali Rama's son was called, and he was asked what vegetable he ate the night before. 
train_hindifullfemale_01993| The child replied, the brinjal and it was the tastiest vegetable I have ever eaten. 
train_hindifullfemale_01994| Chief Minister Appaji told Tenali Rama, Now you will have to accept your guilt. 
train_hindifullfemale_01995| Why should I when I'm not guilty? replied Tenali Rama. 
train_hindifullfemale_01996| The boy went to sleep very early last night and seems to have had many dreams. 
train_hindifullfemale_01997| That is why he is talking nonsense about brinjals and rain and what not. 
train_hindifullfemale_01998| Ask him if it rained last night or not. 
train_hindifullfemale_01999| Appaji asked the child, How was the weather last night? 
train_hindifullfemale_02000| Was the sky clear or did it rain?. 
train_hindifullfemale_02001| The child replied, It rained heavily last night. 
train_hindifullfemale_02002| All my clothes got wet when I slept on the roof. 
train_hindifullfemale_02003| The fact was, not a single drop of rain had fallen on Vijaynagar that day. 
train_hindifullfemale_02004| Appaji had no option but to get rid of his suspicions in the face of such apparent madness. 
train_hindifullfemale_02005| He apologised to Tenali Rama for having suspected him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02006| Tenaliraman was mischievous during his childhood. 
train_hindifullfemale_02007| His childishness cheered some and troubled some. 
train_hindifullfemale_02008| His activities were pleasure to some and humiliation to others. 
train_hindifullfemale_02009| Once, while Tenaliraman was pursuing his academics, the provincial ruler visited the school as part of checking the standards of the school. 
train_hindifullfemale_02010| He questioned the children in the classroom, Who among you is the most intelligent? 
train_hindifullfemale_02011| Silence spread in the class, No child dared to give reply to the King's question. 
train_hindifullfemale_02012| Meanwhile, Tenaliraman sprung up from his seat and answered with confidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02013| I am the intelligent student in the class. 
train_hindifullfemale_02014| The King appreciated Tenaliraman's confidence and courage. 
train_hindifullfemale_02015| Calling him closer, the King enquired him about several things and blessed him, You will go places my child. 
train_hindifullfemale_02016| Similarly, Tenaliraman grew big and made his presence felt in history. 
train_hindifullfemale_02017| Tenaliraman practiced poetry and composition along with command on language and grammar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02018| Mingling with a group of minstrels, he learnt the art of spontaneous poetry composing techniques at Tenali. 
train_hindifullfemale_02019| He made himself a perfectionist in Sanskrit and Telugu languages. 
train_hindifullfemale_02020| Gradually, in the natural process of growing up, he was married and was blessed with children. 
train_hindifullfemale_02021| From then onwards, he was compelled to find ways to earn a living and feed his family. 
train_hindifullfemale_02022| He learnt that Vijaya Nagar ruler Sri Krishna Deva Rayar was a revered patron for poetry and poets. 
train_hindifullfemale_02023| He was also a scholar in Kannada, Andhra and Sanskrit languages on par. 
train_hindifullfemale_02024| Tenaliraman headed for Vijaya Nagar to get into the royal court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02025| First, he approached the royal priest Thathacharya and laid his heart before him, after exhibiting his skills. 
train_hindifullfemale_02026| Thathacharya promised Tenaliraman to introduce him to the King Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02027| Satisfied Tenaliraman spent many a days in vain, waiting for the opportunity. 
train_hindifullfemale_02028| Tenaliraman was vexed and started hunting for alternative ways that would gain entry into the court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02029| He then located Nandi Thimmana, another scholar who had a permanent place in the royal court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02030| Tenaliraman approached Thimmana and appeased him with his expertise in spontaneous poetry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02031| Thimmana felicitated Tenaliraman by presenting him with a Kashmir Shawl. 
train_hindifullfemale_02032| The shawl was presented to him by King Rayar the previous day for his performance. 
train_hindifullfemale_02033| The next day, Tenaliraman adorning the Kashmiri Shawl on his shoulders walked into the royal court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02034| King Rayar was discussing various issues with the courtiers at that time. 
train_hindifullfemale_02035| Rayar was surprised to see a stranger in the Shawl that was presented to Thimmana couple of days before. 
train_hindifullfemale_02036| A straight question came from the King Rayar, Where did you get this shawl? 
train_hindifullfemale_02037| With all humbleness Tenaliraman replied, My King! Thimmana could have satisfied you with his proficiency. 
train_hindifullfemale_02038| I was fortunate enough to please that great personality with my poetry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02039| Thimmana, pleased with my expertise he continued, presented me this shawl felicitating me at his residence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02040| I am wearing this to exhibit my competence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02041| Sri Krishna Deva Rayar was impressed by the way Tenaliraman presented himself in the court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02042| The King also appreciated the intelligence and presence of mind Tenaliraman had. 
train_hindifullfemale_02043| Immediately Rayar offered a position to Tenaliraman in his court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02044| Thus was the entry of Tenaliraman into VijayaNagar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02045| The story of Mahabharat and Delhi Sultan's wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02046| Tenaliraman Stories ruled parts of the sub continent with Delhi as their capital for over two centuries. 
train_hindifullfemale_02047| Few of the Mohamadheen rulers maintained patience towards Hindu rituals and maintained communal harmony encouraging Hindu scholars and prophets. 
train_hindifullfemale_02048| Delhi was in Adil Shah's rule concurrently while Sri Krishna Deva Rayar was ruling Vijaya Nagar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02049| A war broke out between the two kingdoms for supremacy over one another. 
train_hindifullfemale_02050| At one stage, both the rulers felt there was a need to establish peace in the region. 
train_hindifullfemale_02051| Adil Shah invited Rayar to Delhi for finalizing the peace treaty. 
train_hindifullfemale_02052| Hoping to utilize the opportunity to establish a cordial relation between the two empires. 
train_hindifullfemale_02053| Rayar headed for Delhi with a big team comprising of poets, dancers, scholars and others. 
train_hindifullfemale_02054| At Delhi, Adil Shah gave red carpet welcome to Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02055| During the pleasant rounds of discussions, Adil Shah urged the scholars and poets from the Rayar band to recite some sequences from the epic Mahabharat. 
train_hindifullfemale_02056| The visitors recited several sequences to please the Delhi Sultan. 
train_hindifullfemale_02057| It was then that trouble shot up for the Vijaya Nagar ruler. 
train_hindifullfemale_02058| Adil Shah expressed his wish and requested Rayar to make his men rewrite the Mahabharat portraying him and his friends as Pandavas and his rivals as Kauravas. 
train_hindifullfemale_02059| The total visiting team was shocked to hear the Sultan. 
train_hindifullfemale_02060| They somehow managed to close the day's meeting immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_02061| Rayar was worried about the development. 
train_hindifullfemale_02062| He called for an emergency meeting with the learned persons of his team. 
train_hindifullfemale_02063| In the meeting, he sought suggestions from them to avert the problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_02064| Everyone started scratching their heads to find an amicable solution. 
train_hindifullfemale_02065| None could come out with any concrete proposal. 
train_hindifullfemale_02066| After watching all this, suddenly Tenaliraman raised and put his proposal before Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02067| He said, My Lord! I think there is not much for you or us to get so much worried and burdened about the Delhi Sultan's wish about Mahabharat. 
train_hindifullfemale_02068| You please leave the problem onto my shoulders and have a relaxed sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_02069| I will solve the problem without any problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_02070| The King Rayar had his own doubts about the safety of the kingdom and its people. 
train_hindifullfemale_02071| Rayar said, Tenaliraman I am aware that you are a genius. 
train_hindifullfemale_02072| However, it is not a common situation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02073| Dealing with the Delhi Sultan is not an easy job. 
train_hindifullfemale_02074| It is similar to fete on the edge of a sword. 
train_hindifullfemale_02075| You should be very careful! He was worried that the problem might not be dealt with properly 
train_hindifullfemale_02076| There was a chance that Delhi Sultan might declare a war on Vijaya Nagar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02077| Tenaliraman was stiff to his argument and assured everyone to leave the matter to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02078| The big heads of the meeting could not comprehend how Tenaliraman was confident that he could solve this so easily!. 
train_hindifullfemale_02079| Anyway, they told each other, as we could not come out with any proposal for the solution, let him handle this. 
train_hindifullfemale_02080| The meeting finally nominated Tenaliraman to take care of the situation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02081| Next morning, the court was packed with both the rulers and their henchmen. 
train_hindifullfemale_02082| Adil Shah recalled his wish about re composing of the Mahabharat. 
train_hindifullfemale_02083| Tenaliraman rose from his seat and saluted the Sultan. 
train_hindifullfemale_02084| King, All of our poets are into the job assigned by your majesty's wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02085| However, every one of us is stuck at one specific issue. 
train_hindifullfemale_02086| It is not proper for us to discuss the subject in the court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02087| If you can kindly permit me, I wish to present the poking issue before you in private. 
train_hindifullfemale_02088| Adil Shah thought that there should really be some problem and consented for the one on one meeting with Tenaliraman in a separate room. 
train_hindifullfemale_02089| Tenaliraman folding hands and presenting all respects to the Sultan in his words started, Your Highness, You are the king of kings! 
train_hindifullfemale_02090| It was our pleasure to know about your inclination about our epics like Mahabharat. 
train_hindifullfemale_02091| The poets and scholars, started re composing the whole epic, in accordance to your majesty's wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02092| You are being portrayed as Dharmaraja, eldest of Pandavas and your friends as Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva. 
train_hindifullfemale_02093| Tenaliraman paused a second and continued, This is where we had to scratch our brains. 
train_hindifullfemale_02094| However he was not forth coming with the problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_02095| Adil Shah waited and when it was clear that he has to get it out of Tenaliraman he ordered, What is the problem? 
train_hindifullfemale_02096| Tell me clearly and quickly. 
train_hindifullfemale_02097| You are aware King That Pandavas are five. 
train_hindifullfemale_02098| All the five were married to Draupadi and were sharing her equally Tenaliraman stressed. 
train_hindifullfemale_02099| We are unable to portray your image as Dharmaraja in this regard, thinking about the prestige of the King of Kings. 
train_hindifullfemale_02100| Long before Tenaliraman could complete, Adil Shah hastened to say, Stop this nonsense now. 
train_hindifullfemale_02101| I cannot take this anymore, Stop rewriting Mahabharat immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_02102| I can never accept this, Tenaliraman tried to say, King We started to work as per your wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02103| Now, how can we turn away from the word given to you by us. 
train_hindifullfemale_02104| Look Poet! Adil Shah raised his voice, you should drop the Mahabharat topic as of now if you wish the friendship and co operation between the two kingdoms to last long. 
train_hindifullfemale_02105| Is that clear and walked off the room. 
train_hindifullfemale_02106| Tenaliraman bubbling with joy returned to his King Rayar and his bandwagon of delegation and explained the whole sequence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02107| Everyone including Rayar appreciated the sharp intelligence and presence of mind Tenaliraman had in solving the toughest problem just like that! 
train_hindifullfemale_02108| Days were passing like this. 
train_hindifullfemale_02109| One morning, a vendor with a load of firewood on his head started shouting in front of her house, Firewood! strong firewood! 
train_hindifullfemale_02110| Excess heat generating firewood! he continued the sequence for sometime. 
train_hindifullfemale_02111| One rich woman in that street thinking that his noise was growing unbearable walked on to the threshold. 
train_hindifullfemale_02112| She enquired, How much do you sell the load for? 
train_hindifullfemale_02113| An instant reply came from the vendor, I will not sell this for money. 
train_hindifullfemale_02114| If you can give me a handful grain I will give you all the load. 
train_hindifullfemale_02115| Assuring him to give more grains, Lady ordered him to dump the load in the backyard and return to collect the grains. 
train_hindifullfemale_02116| The vendor unloaded the weight off his head then and there started to argue, There is no bargain in this deal Madam! 
train_hindifullfemale_02117| I will sell this to you only if you can give me a handful grain, did you get it he stressed, a handful grain. 
train_hindifullfemale_02118| The rich woman got disgusted with the vendor's behaviour, You bloody vendor. 
train_hindifullfemale_02119| Stop crying, I will give you what you wanted. 
train_hindifullfemale_02120| She said, throw them in the backyard and come here. 
train_hindifullfemale_02121| The Vendor was adamant and made his firewood load's price much more clearer, There is no change in the deal Madam. 
train_hindifullfemale_02122| I said a handful grain. That means nothing more or less. 
train_hindifullfemale_02123| It should be a handful grain. 
train_hindifullfemale_02124| If you cannot pay the price, you should pay me one thousand gold coins and wipe the invitation hoarding on the compound wall. 
train_hindifullfemale_02125| The Lady yelled at him, What nonsense are you trying to talk? 
train_hindifullfemale_02126| The vendor replied on par with her, There is not any nonsense. 
train_hindifullfemale_02127| I told you the price, you agreed for it and now if you cannot pay the price, stand by my wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02128| You should give the one thousand gold coins That is it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02129| The fight broke out between the Lady and the firewood vendor. 
train_hindifullfemale_02130| Both started arguing and shouting at each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_02131| The local people started gathering in front of the house to witness and know what is happening and why is the Lady having a tiff with an ordinary vendor. 
train_hindifullfemale_02132| Tired of shouting, both resorted to approach the provincial Court of Law for justice. 
train_hindifullfemale_02133| The Lady presented her argument, My Lord! This firewood vendor must have gone crazy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02134| He is not ready to accede to my offer, though I wished to pay him more. 
train_hindifullfemale_02135| He is sticking to his senseless argument to have a handful grain. 
train_hindifullfemale_02136| He demands later for payment of a thousand gold coins and wiping away the invitation hoarding. 
train_hindifullfemale_02137| I plead for justice. The Judge looked at the vendor and asked him what was his problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_02138| Folding hands the vendor started in a humble manner, Yes Your Majesty. 
train_hindifullfemale_02139| She was right to some extent. However, I am not crazy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02140| I informed her beforehand that the load of firewood would cost her a handful grain. 
train_hindifullfemale_02141| He continued innocently, When I was clear about a handful grain, she must have understood that I needed handful of grains. 
train_hindifullfemale_02142| That was her mistake to mistake my quote for a handful grain. 
train_hindifullfemale_02143| It means, one grain that fills the hand, What more? 
train_hindifullfemale_02144| The Lady was speechless, Obviously, the verdict was in favour of the vendor. 
train_hindifullfemale_02145| The rich Lady was unable to comprehend that a handful grain meant so much. 
train_hindifullfemale_02146| Shocked with the development and the judgment, she was compelled to pay him one thousand gold coins and wipe off the invitation from the compound wall. 
train_hindifullfemale_02147| The people of the region knew about this and told themselves that the years old proudness of Lady was shattered to pieces in a single stroke. 
train_hindifullfemale_02148| By the way, the vendor was Tenaliraman . 
train_hindifullfemale_02149| On hearing about the problem, the Lady created with her hoarding, Tenaliraman took due permission from the King Rayar to take her to task. 
train_hindifullfemale_02150| In the guise of firewood vendor, Tenaliraman fulfilled his responsibility in all success. 
train_hindifullfemale_02151| Tenali raman story about The Last Wish, a Mango Fruit. 
train_hindifullfemale_02152| Once when King Sri Krishna Deva Rayar was ruling the Vijaya Nagar Empire, the royal mother fell sick and was bedridden. 
train_hindifullfemale_02153| The medical professionals of the court declared that there was no chance for her to survive this episode. 
train_hindifullfemale_02154| She grew too old to respond to any medication. 
train_hindifullfemale_02155| One morning, she summoned Rayar to her presence. My Dear Son! I realised that I am close to death's door. 
train_hindifullfemale_02156| I also do not have any hopes that my health would become better, However, I have a last wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02157| She paused and asked, Can you accomplish it for me before my soul is taken away? 
train_hindifullfemale_02158| Rayar was the King of Kings. His mother was on the deathbed, expressing her last wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02159| How could he turn away from it? 
train_hindifullfemale_02160| He gently said, Mother! Please tell me I will definitely accomplish your last wish he assured. 
train_hindifullfemale_02161| She said, I wish to eat a mango fruit, can you get me one? in a feeble tone the mother asked Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02162| It was early summer. Trees had just started bearing tender fruits. 
train_hindifullfemale_02163| There was no guarantee that royal mother would live until the tender ones ripened on the tree, Rayar thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_02164| It was also an insult to his royalty, if he was unable to fulfil his mother's last wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02165| Immediately the King ordered his soldiers to scan through the fields of the kingdom and bring some ripe mangoes at any cost, immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_02166| The soldiers plunged into action. 
train_hindifullfemale_02167| They did their best and returned with a basket filled with ripe mangoes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02168| Eventually, just before the soldiers could place the basket before their King, king's mother breathed her last. 
train_hindifullfemale_02169| Rayar was taken aback, for being unable to fulfil the last wish more than for her demise. 
train_hindifullfemale_02170| He was shook deeply with the thought that his mother was dead even before her quench for mangoes was fulfilled. 
train_hindifullfemale_02171| He slowly started to sink day after day with the thoughts that were ripping him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02172| Rayar invited Royal Master Thathacharya, explained his struggle, and sought an advice that would take the suffering off from him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02173| Thathacharya thought for a while and told the King, My king! Your mother was fond of giving alms to the poor and needy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02174| Her soul would rest in peace, if you can fulfil her last wish through donations. 
train_hindifullfemale_02175| Order for preparing mangoes with gold and distribute them to Brahmins of the country. 
train_hindifullfemale_02176| The news spread like wildfire in the kingdom that Rayar was doling out golden mangoes to Brahmins in the memory of his mother. 
train_hindifullfemale_02177| Brahmins from all over the empire started flooding into the capital to accept the golden mango from the King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02178| Day in and out, long queues were always seen only to add people to its tail. 
train_hindifullfemale_02179| With this, the gold reserves in the exchequer were melting down rapidly. 
train_hindifullfemale_02180| Rayar not bothering about the consequences was incessantly involved in donating golden mangoes to the Brahmins. 
train_hindifullfemale_02181| He never heeded to the pleas and warnings of the Chief Minister Thimmarusu in this regard. 
train_hindifullfemale_02182| Thimmarusu was in confusion and did not know how to stop the King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02183| He approached Tenaliraman and urged for a solution to this in the interest of the kingdom and its people. 
train_hindifullfemale_02184| Tenaliraman assured Thimmarusu that he would check it at the earliest. 
train_hindifullfemale_02185| Go home and have a sound night sleep, Chief Minister. 
train_hindifullfemale_02186| Everything will be alright by tomorrow evening Tenaliraman sent off Thimmarusu. 
train_hindifullfemale_02187| Next morning, Tenaliraman went near the long queues and watched what was happening. 
train_hindifullfemale_02188| He then selected a yard close to the queues and sat there, ordering the queue maintenance persons to send each of the Brahmins to him before sending him to Rayar for the golden mango. 
train_hindifullfemale_02189| Everyone knew that Tenaliraman was one of the close associates of the King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02190| They thought that Tenaliraman was doing so on the orders of the King and started sending the Brahmins first to Tenaliraman before sending them into the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_02191| Tenaliraman told every Brahmin that there was a slight amendment to the donation process. 
train_hindifullfemale_02192| The King Rayar wished to donate the golden mangoes to those who bore a blister from him 
train_hindifullfemale_02193| Tenaliraman explained. Brahmins desirous of the gold first had a burn on their backs and went for the King's gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_02194| This went on until afternoon. 
train_hindifullfemale_02195| In the late afternoon, one Brahmin pleaded Tenaliraman to give him two burns and two golden mangoes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02196| Tenaliraman immediately fulfilled the Brahmins wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02197| Then the Brahmin approached Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02198| As usual, Rayar handed him one mango. 
train_hindifullfemale_02199| The Brahmin immediately requested the King, My Lord! I had two burns please give me two golden mangoes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02200| The King Rayar did not understand what was happening, He enquired, What burns? 
train_hindifullfemale_02201| Then the Brahmin narrated the entire story about Tenaliraman and burns to Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02202| The King shivering with anger called for Tenaliraman and questioned him, Tenali Rama, what is happening. 
train_hindifullfemale_02203| Why are you doing this brutality on these poor and innocent Brahmins? 
train_hindifullfemale_02204| Tenaliraman very politely and innocently, as if nothing was amiss, explained. 
train_hindifullfemale_02205| My Dear King! I am an unlucky person. 
train_hindifullfemale_02206| Recently my mother succumbed to a chronic disease. 
train_hindifullfemale_02207| She wished all during her bed ridden period to cauterize her back so that she could become healthy and live longer. 
train_hindifullfemale_02208| Wiping the tears dropping on his cheeks, Tenaliraman continued, Probably she would have lived. 
train_hindifullfemale_02209| Nevertheless, I did not heed to her requests. 
train_hindifullfemale_02210| She died with it on her lips. 
train_hindifullfemale_02211| I thought of presenting it to the Brahmins, as I failed to fulfil my mother's last wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02212| However, me being a poor man cannot invite such huge number of Brahmins. 
train_hindifullfemale_02213| Anyway, all of these had come on your invitation and I am trying to fulfil my mother's last wish in this manner. 
train_hindifullfemale_02214| With all due respects to the King, I beg for pardon for my deeds, if I am wrong. 
train_hindifullfemale_02215| Rayar analysed that Tenaliraman was attempting to teach him a lesson. 
train_hindifullfemale_02216| He then recalled Thimmarusu's pleas about the drastically dropping gold reserves in the exchequer. 
train_hindifullfemale_02217| Appreciating the presence of mind and loyalty, Rayar immediately stopped the program. 
train_hindifullfemale_02218| Tenaliraman Story about The Secret of Weaving Invisible Fabric. 
train_hindifullfemale_02219| A gorgeous woman entered the royal court of Sri Krishna Deva Rayar when he was busy with the courtiers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02220| With all her pleasing manners, attire and conversation, she attracted the gathering that day. 
train_hindifullfemale_02221| After a little dialogue with the King and his prime staff, she took out something. 
train_hindifullfemale_02222| The most delicate and flimsiest sari was removed from a small box that would hardly be sufficient to place a pair of ear tops. 
train_hindifullfemale_02223| Exhibiting the saree to the royal court attendants, she addressed the king, King of Kings! A group of divine weavers are working for me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02224| They can weave similar delicate, thinnest and beautiful saris. 
train_hindifullfemale_02225| They are capable of weaving celestial fabric, which cannot be seen with the naked eye. 
train_hindifullfemale_02226| If we have your majesty's blessings and support in addition to appropriate allocation of funds, they can do wonders and exhibit before the honorable King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02227| Satisfied with the exhibit, Rayar believed her words. 
train_hindifullfemale_02228| Allotting required funds for weaving the celestial fabric. 
train_hindifullfemale_02229| Rayar asked her to get the job done with thorough research within the year. 
train_hindifullfemale_02230| The gorgeous woman and her weavers enjoyed the comforts and treatment extended by the King to the royal court guests for one year. 
train_hindifullfemale_02231| Even after the lapse of one year, there was no news from the woman about the research nor the weavers exhibited any products before the King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02232| Rayar ordered some of his employees to inspect the weavers' guesthouse and enquire about the weaving of celestial fabric that was fit to be worn by the Gods. 
train_hindifullfemale_02233| The royal employees at once left for the guesthouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_02234| The woman welcomed the inspectors and took them to the location where the weavers were working seriously not even noticing the presence of guests in the room. 
train_hindifullfemale_02235| The inspectors were aghast when they entered the room. 
train_hindifullfemale_02236| There were no looms, no thread spools, not even a string of thread in the room. 
train_hindifullfemale_02237| All the weavers sitting there were pretending to draw threads and weave. 
train_hindifullfemale_02238| Every act was as if they were weaving something, with empty hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_02239| The inspectors could not understand what was happening there. 
train_hindifullfemale_02240| They asked the woman about the invisible fabric. 
train_hindifullfemale_02241| She threw a lovely smile at them and told in a low husky voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_02242| Gentlemen, the invisible or celestial fabric is visible to only those who are pure along with purity of their parents. 
train_hindifullfemale_02243| Of course, I believe that you can see the clarity of design and beauty of the craftsmanship of our weavers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02244| The inspectors were worried of being branded as sinners, if they spoke truth about what they saw. 
train_hindifullfemale_02245| They did not dare to probe against the guests. 
train_hindifullfemale_02246| Moreover, they appreciated the delicacy, accuracy, and what not about the work being done at the guesthouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_02247| They stood by the roles they played at the guesthouse, in front of the King Rayar too. 
train_hindifullfemale_02248| The feedback of the employees augmented the enthusiasm of Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02249| He was eagerly waiting for the finished products to be exhibited before him and the royal court members. 
train_hindifullfemale_02250| Some days later, Rayar ordered his men to bring the weavers to his court along with the finished products. 
train_hindifullfemale_02251| An unusually big gathering assembled in the royal court to witness the celestial fabric exhibition. 
train_hindifullfemale_02252| As part of the introductory speech, the weavers addressed the gathering. 
train_hindifullfemale_02253| They pointed out that the fabric was made from various divine materials. 
train_hindifullfemale_02254| Hence, they would be visible only to those who are clean by soul along with purity of their parents. 
train_hindifullfemale_02255| The whole gathering went silent for a moment, as no one could see any fabric in the hands of the weavers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02256| Still, they maintained, out of fear of humiliation, that they were able to view the exhibit, started applauding the beauty, and praised the weavers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02257| Just then, King Rayar accompanied by Tenaliraman, entered the court to witness the exhibition. 
train_hindifullfemale_02258| Weavers repeated their standard phrases. 
train_hindifullfemale_02259| Rayar stared at the hands of the weavers for a moment and whispered to Tenaliraman, I regret to say, I cannot see any material in their hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_02260| Is that my own sin or my parents'? 
train_hindifullfemale_02261| Nothing comes to be visible in thin air, My Lord! replied Tenaliraman . 
train_hindifullfemale_02262| Rayar grew suspicious, What do you mean? he asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_02263| Tenaliraman in a low tone audible only to the King said, King of Kings! These weavers are cheating our eyes and brains with their deceptive speech. 
train_hindifullfemale_02264| Rayar urged Tenaliraman to make public, the cheating of the weavers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02265| Tenaliraman, turned towards the gorgeous woman, and, in an astoundingly inquisitive tone asked 
train_hindifullfemale_02266| What a beauty! How rich are these textiles, Lady. 
train_hindifullfemale_02267| The King of Kings Rayar is anxious to view your stepped up decorum, if you wear those celestial material. 
train_hindifullfemale_02268| The lady understood that Tenaliraman deciphered the secret of invisible weaving. 
train_hindifullfemale_02269| She was confused for a moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_02270| She could neither disregard the King's order nor stand nude in the crowded court in the guise of wearing something, which actually was nothing. 
train_hindifullfemale_02271| She thought that the only way out would be to fall on the King's feet pleading mercy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02272| Immediately she did so begging for pardon. 
train_hindifullfemale_02273| This was how Tenaliraman was once again instrumental in protecting his King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02274| Since then, nudity is being referred as wearing divine clothes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02275| It was the practice of King Sri Krishna Deva Rayar to visit the jails once a while and review the living standards of the convicted. 
train_hindifullfemale_02276| During one of his visits, two of the jail inmates pleaded for cutting down their punishment period. 
train_hindifullfemale_02277| They explained that theft was one of the sixty four arts in the epics and Vedas and started defining the art of stealing. 
train_hindifullfemale_02278| However, they argued that they would shed the lifestyle and shift for one or the other profession to eke out their living. 
train_hindifullfemale_02279| Rayar thought for a moment brushing his moustache royally. 
train_hindifullfemale_02280| It's alright thieves, First let me know about your expertise in the art and then decide. 
train_hindifullfemale_02281| You both have to burgle at Tenaliraman's house and return. 
train_hindifullfemale_02282| If you emerge successful, then you will be set free immediately Rayar ordered them. 
train_hindifullfemale_02283| you both listen, You should not deliver any physical blows to the households, take care he added one condition. 
train_hindifullfemale_02284| The same night they were officially let out for robbing Tenaliraman's residence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02285| Tenaliraman was nurturing a beautiful backyard garden fondly. 
train_hindifullfemale_02286| Both the thieves crossed over the backyard compound wall and took shelter in the bean bushes to watch the surroundings first. 
train_hindifullfemale_02287| Tenaliraman was not just another ordinary man in the crowd. 
train_hindifullfemale_02288| He spotted the thieves hiding in the bushes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02289| He called his wife loudly, My dear wife! Come here fast. 
train_hindifullfemale_02290| The whole town is on fire with the news about some convicts jumping jail and are said to be at large well within the town. 
train_hindifullfemale_02291| We should immediately protect all our jewellery and other valuable. 
train_hindifullfemale_02292| Saying this and by watching carefully around the bushes, increased the pitch and shouted. 
train_hindifullfemale_02293| Bring that bundle with all our gold and jewellery. 
train_hindifullfemale_02294| A minute later, Tenaliraman and his wife with great effort brought a heavy bundle into the backyard and dropped it into the well with big noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_02295| Sounds of a heavy weight dropping into the water in the well echoed for few seconds. 
train_hindifullfemale_02296| The thieves looked at each other with sparkles in their eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02297| After drawing water from the well for three to four hours continuously, the thieves were tired. 
train_hindifullfemale_02298| One of them again went into the well and came back, You, come I need help to bring the bundle out, it is too heavy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02299| Both of them slipped into the well together again. 
train_hindifullfemale_02300| With great effort, both of them brought the bundle out and fell on the ground like logs of wood after opening it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02301| To their dismay, it was not a bundle of jewellery but a bundle of small boulders and rocks. 
train_hindifullfemale_02302| They never understood until then that Tenaliraman hid his precious items somewhere in the house and dropped this into the well. 
train_hindifullfemale_02303| Tenaliraman called them, dear thieves! Please draw few more buckets of water from the well. 
train_hindifullfemale_02304| Only two of the plants are to be watered. 
train_hindifullfemale_02305| Please hurry up it is close to dawn. 
train_hindifullfemale_02306| Kindly help me quick and little more like sprinkling chilies on the wounds of burglars. 
train_hindifullfemale_02307| Both of them were stunned on hearing Tenaliraman 's voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_02308| They told each other, Run! It is Tenaliraman! and sped away crossing the wall with all the tired bodies. 
train_hindifullfemale_02309| The so called argument of the thieves about the art of stealing and their expertise did not work on Tenaliraman at least. 
train_hindifullfemale_02310| The Weird Wells' Wedding Invitation story of Tenaliraman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02311| During the period when Sri Krishna Deva Rayar was ruling the Vijaya Nagar Empire with Hampi as his capital, Mohamadheen Sultans were ruling Delhi. 
train_hindifullfemale_02312| The Sultans were powerful and were ruling many parts of Northern India. 
train_hindifullfemale_02313| They were always attempting to invade on Hindu ruled kingdoms and grab them into their fold. 
train_hindifullfemale_02314| For declaring war the Sultans used to find one or the other ploy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02315| The Delhi Sultan once got an idea to insult and instantly he sent a wedding invitation to Sri Krishna Deva Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02316| Going through the contents of the invitation, the royal court VijayaNagar and the King Rayar went speechless. 
train_hindifullfemale_02317| The invitation read as, Wedding Invitation, We propose to perform marriage to the newly dug Well in our kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_02318| We have the pleasure of inviting all the wells in your kingdom to attend the ritual and their presence is solicited. 
train_hindifullfemale_02319| Date of marriage and location was also mentioned in the invitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02320| The tremor did not stop there. 
train_hindifullfemale_02321| A warning letter was attached along with the invitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02322| The warning letter said that in case the King failed to send all the wells in the concerned kingdom, such action would be treated as an insult. 
train_hindifullfemale_02323| That will be liable to face the fury of the Delhi sultan. 
train_hindifullfemale_02324| Rayar, on receiving the invitation along with the letter through a personal messenger from the Sultan of Delhi could not understand what to do about this invitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02325| This is because, everyone knew that sending wells from one place to another is practically above impossible. 
train_hindifullfemale_02326| Rayar was in total confusion what to do and what to reply. 
train_hindifullfemale_02327| Thinking for sometime to find a solution to this problem, in vain, Rayar forwarded the puzzling wedding invitation and warning letter to the Chief Minister Thimmarusu. 
train_hindifullfemale_02328| He also included a message to come out with a viable solution. 
train_hindifullfemale_02329| Thimmarusu found the invitation to be too strange and the problem like a complex puzzle. 
train_hindifullfemale_02330| What an invitation? Thimmarusu thought, inviting wells of Vijaya Nagar Empire to the wedding of a well at Delhi! 
train_hindifullfemale_02331| Even Thimmarusu could not draw out any thought close to solution that can be effective in avoiding any rift between the two kingdoms. 
train_hindifullfemale_02332| Thimmarusu approached King Rayar and expressed his inability to draw out any solution. 
train_hindifullfemale_02333| Rayar was much more tensed on hearing his Chief Minister. 
train_hindifullfemale_02334| Then, Thimmarusu convinced Rayar that there was no need to get so much worried, as there is a man in the service of the King, who can draw a best amicable equation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02335| Rayar asked about the person Thimmarusu was referring to. 
train_hindifullfemale_02336| Immediately, Thimmarusu told the King that it was none other than poet Tenaliraman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02337| Taking the King's permission, Thimmarusu headed to Tenaliraman's residence and explained the whole sequence along with the worries of the King Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02338| Tenaliraman in a cool fashion studied the invitation and the warning letter. 
train_hindifullfemale_02339| He told Thimmarusu, Dear Chief Minister Thimmarusu! The Delhi Sultan must be attempting to humiliate the Hindu rituals and customs. 
train_hindifullfemale_02340| You know Hindus have a ritual of performing enlivening to the newly dug wells. 
train_hindifullfemale_02341| A wonderful thought must have struck the Sultan's mind to perform marriage to the well instead of prathista to the well. 
train_hindifullfemale_02342| He continued thinking for a moment, There is no problem either with the invitation or the warning letter. 
train_hindifullfemale_02343| There is nothing to worry, You go home peacefully and relax. 
train_hindifullfemale_02344| Tenaliraman assured Thimmarusu, I will give out the best solution to this problem in the VijayaNagar tomorrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_02345| As usual, the VijayaNagar started its session the next morning, but there was no charm or shine in anyone's face including the King Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02346| All of them were worried about the solution to the Delhi Sultan's created problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_02347| Amid the gloomy atmosphere, Tenaliraman rose from his seat and started reading a reply prepared by him on behalf of King Rayar to Delhi Sultan. 
train_hindifullfemale_02348| To His Excellency, the Sultan of Delhi. 
train_hindifullfemale_02349| We acknowledge your invitation inviting our wells for the wedding of a well in your kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_02350| We are glad and grateful that you remembered us for the memorable occasion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02351| On receiving your invitation, we immediately read the message to all the wells in our Kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_02352| Those wells are resenting your wells, as they did not attend their wedding. 
train_hindifullfemale_02353| Hence, we keep you informed that if your wells personally come to Vijaya Nagar and invite, our wells will definitely oblige the invitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02354| Therefore, you are requested to send your wells here to invite our wells personally to the wedding ritual. 
train_hindifullfemale_02355| Once your wells come here, our wells and we together will come to Delhi for the wedding. 
train_hindifullfemale_02356| Hoping to welcome your wells at the earliest, Yours' sincerely, Sri Krishna Deva Rayar, Vijaya Nagar Ruler . 
train_hindifullfemale_02357| The total gathering of the VijayaNagar cheered at once on hearing the reply intellectually composed by Tenaliraman and appreciated him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02358| This reply was sent to Delhi Sultan with a personal messenger. 
train_hindifullfemale_02359| Sultan of Delhi was shocked with the reply received and questioned the messenger, how can we send the wells with you? 
train_hindifullfemale_02360| Without any second thought Sultan dropped the proposals of humiliating Hindu rituals along with the thought of waging war unnecessarily on Hindu ruled kingdoms. 
train_hindifullfemale_02361| Moreover, the Sultan appreciating the intelligence and wit King Rayar had in replying his invitation and warning, sent many gifts and Farmans with the messenger to Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02362| How an Elephant's fleet junks in a mosquito's throat? 
train_hindifullfemale_02363| Among the eight scholars in the VijayaNagar of Sri Krishna Deva Rayar, the King for his ingenuity, quick wittedness, and fast filling of stanzas when at test particularly favoured Tenaliraman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02364| Rayar was renowned as Andhra Bhoja and Poet's Paradise. 
train_hindifullfemale_02365| With his inherent qualities of wit and sarcasm, Tenaliraman was growing big and closer to Rayar day after day. 
train_hindifullfemale_02366| With no change in the rule, the more you grow the more envious you become, the other courtiers like Rama King Bhushana were against the growth of Tenaliraman's association with the King Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02367| Whenever there is a possibility, those courtiers, and Rama King Bhushana had been working towards damaging Tenaliraman's image and slinging mud on him before the King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02368| Tenaliraman efficiently countered these efforts and trials of courtiers all the time. 
train_hindifullfemale_02369| At one stage, as these personalities were unable to compete with Tenaliraman in wit and ingenuity decided to humiliate Tenaliraman . 
train_hindifullfemale_02370| They handed over the responsibility of insulting Tenaliraman to the main entrance guards. 
train_hindifullfemale_02371| Those poor soldiers were lured by the bribe amount the courtiers had offered them. 
train_hindifullfemale_02372| A line was given to those guards for stopping Tenaliraman at the entrance itself. 
train_hindifullfemale_02373| The line was an elephants' fleet is stuck in a mosquito's throat. 
train_hindifullfemale_02374| Tenaliraman as usual was walking into the VijayaNagar premises and the guards stopped him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02375| He questioned why were they blocking the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_02376| The soldiers told Tenaliraman about the line and asked him to enter the premises only after reciting the first three lines for the last line they recited to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02377| Tenaliraman boiled and trembled with anger on those soldiers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02378| Immediately he understood what and who was behind the soldiers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02379| With harsh words he completed reciting. 
train_hindifullfemale_02380| Long before those guards could understand the meaning of the poem, Tenaliraman walked stiff into the main court hall. 
train_hindifullfemale_02381| After sometime, while the King Rayar was into one of the pleasure rounds of literary discussions, the guards entered the hall and complained that Tenaliraman disgraced them with the poem at the main entrance. 
train_hindifullfemale_02382| After listening to all the details narrated by the guards, Rayar ordered Tenaliraman to extempore compose a poem taking the same end line with a situation in Mahabharatha. 
train_hindifullfemale_02383| Tenaliraman raised from his seat and after salutations to the King Rayar recited, he said another poem. 
train_hindifullfemale_02384| Pandavas in Mahabharatha are like a fleet of powerful elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_02385| Losing in the gamble with Gauravas, they had to live incognito for some time. 
train_hindifullfemale_02386| During this period they served a weak ruler. 
train_hindifullfemale_02387| By all Gods! It is the fate of those Pandavas to serve such a weak person in spite of being renowned warriors. 
train_hindifullfemale_02388| This is similar to a fleet of strong elephants being stuck in the throat of a small mosquito. 
train_hindifullfemale_02389| Rayar clapped in all praise of Tenaliraman for his ingenuity and wit filled narration. 
train_hindifullfemale_02390| In the full house, Rayar hugged Tenaliraman and appreciated him agreeing that Tenaliraman's words are like double edged swords. 
train_hindifullfemale_02391| This state of affairs brought Tenaliraman more close to Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02392| All the attempts to trap Tenaliraman and cut down his image before the King Rayar by the envied courtiers and poet Rama King Bhushana blew off like a piece of raw cotton in Tenali. 
train_hindifullfemale_02393| Raman's intelligence whirlwind, Ramalinaga and Ramayana Recital. 
train_hindifullfemale_02394| Vikrama Simhapuri was part of Vijaya Nagar Empire under the rule of Sri Krishna Deva Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02395| This place was famous for wicked and cunning women. 
train_hindifullfemale_02396| These women with their uncommon intelligence added to their beauty and appeal used to defeat scholars and experts to transform as their domestic slaves and servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_02397| A lady Kanchana Mala among them was too notorious in this regard. 
train_hindifullfemale_02398| In the name of satisfying Ramayana recital, she framed twisty and wicked rules, which made all the competitors lose in their battle against the woman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02399| The lady's reputation along with her condition filled Ramayana recital issue spread all over the region and no one was dared to step into her house to compete with her. 
train_hindifullfemale_02400| In case any one ventured, lured by the stunning beauty of Kanchana Mala they too were definite to lose and become either a slave or a servant to her. 
train_hindifullfemale_02401| One day, Tenaliraman visited Vikrama Simhapuri on his personal accomplishments. 
train_hindifullfemale_02402| Completing his job, he sat with some scholars, reputed persons of the locality, and enquired about the happenings and specialties of the town. 
train_hindifullfemale_02403| The gathering in a synchronized tone explained Tenaliraman about Kanchana Mala and her urge for satisfactory recital of Ramayana epic. 
train_hindifullfemale_02404| One of the associates there said that, it was her celestial beauty and the quantity of reward that was driving scholars to her, who are finally seen serving her losing the competition. 
train_hindifullfemale_02405| One of the senior and aged poet of the region told Tenaliraman cursing her, she is not at all a woman, and she is wicked of the wicked. 
train_hindifullfemale_02406| It is you, the right person, to defeat and smash her pride. 
train_hindifullfemale_02407| He continued, You should teach her a right lesson and release all the scholars suffering in her service. 
train_hindifullfemale_02408| Tenaliraman thought, Oh! Kanchana Mala is that highly impious. 
train_hindifullfemale_02409| He said to the persons around him, That being the case, I should definitely compete with her, by the way, what is the test she is winning on? he questioned. 
train_hindifullfemale_02410| One of them explained that she demands the competitor to recite Ramayana and satisfy her. 
train_hindifullfemale_02411| Every time she says the recital was not satisfactory and orders the competitor to become her slave. 
train_hindifullfemale_02412| Poor fellows, what they can do? 
train_hindifullfemale_02413| The condition of the test was to take out a word satisfied from her after the performance. 
train_hindifullfemale_02414| Enough! It is alright! Tenaliraman told all of them, She just needs to be satisfied with a Ramayana concert, I will do it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02415| One of you keep her informed about my willingness to satisfy her Tenaliraman said and headed towards his accommodation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02416| Not one, but all of them got up to inform Kanchana Mala about Tenaliraman's compliance to recite Ramayana at her residence thinking, Yes! Now the time has come for breaking her. 
train_hindifullfemale_02417| Tenaliraman, in the evening attired in a disguise went to Kanchana Mala's residence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02418| Hearty Welcome! learned man Kanchana Mala invited him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02419| He told Mala, I have come to recite Ramayana as if it is happening in front of your eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02420| That was good, Then, are you aware of the reward and punishments? Mala questioned. 
train_hindifullfemale_02421| I am aware of those Kanchana Mala! I have a request, paused Tenaliraman . 
train_hindifullfemale_02422| Please tell me Sir, Mala immediately responded, Before I complete the total recital you should not say anything. 
train_hindifullfemale_02423| You should do what ever I say as part of the presentation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02424| After I complete the narration you can reward me if you are satisfied or punish otherwise. 
train_hindifullfemale_02425| Tenaliraman sarcastically stated, She agreed to it and the story began. 
train_hindifullfemale_02426| Tenaliraman started with the birth of Rama, Lakshmana, Bharatha, and Sathrughna. 
train_hindifullfemale_02427| It continued with Rama and Lakshmana accompanying with Sage Vishwamithra to protect the celestial sacrifice, killing Thataka, releasing Ahalya from curse. 
train_hindifullfemale_02428| He continued with Rama's marriage with Seetha, by breaking Lord Shiva's bow. 
train_hindifullfemale_02429| Then about Rama's migration to forests along with Seetha and Lakshmana on stepmother Kaikayi's wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02430| Tenaliraman was narrating the episodes with an excellent expression and mannerism in a right modulation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02431| Nowhere, Kanchana Mala looked to be satisfied as she was commenting You are not satisfying me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02432| He advanced with the story narration about Ravanasura kidnapping Seetha, Rama killing Vaali, deploying Hanuman to Lanka with the assistance of Sugreeva. 
train_hindifullfemale_02433| Again Mala screamed, I am not satisfied with your performance. 
train_hindifullfemale_02434| Controlling himself from exploding with anger, Tenaliraman convinced her Kanchana Mala! 
train_hindifullfemale_02435| You are telling me that you are not satisfied with my performance. 
train_hindifullfemale_02436| However, this would be the best of performance on earth ok. 
train_hindifullfemale_02437| Let us leave that, Now get ready, you will witness Ramayana happening in front of you. 
train_hindifullfemale_02438| Yeah please continue, I am in fact waiting for that, she said. 
train_hindifullfemale_02439| Tenaliraman jumped on to her selectively decorated cot and said, This is how Hanuman jumped on to the Peak of Mahendra Mountain. 
train_hindifullfemale_02440| Standing erect on the bed he took another flight and landed on another cot, Like this Hanuman jumped on to another mountain's peak. 
train_hindifullfemale_02441| From there he jumped close to Kanchana Mala and started throwing powerful fists on her back. 
train_hindifullfemale_02442| This was how Hanuman hit Lankini, who blocked his way from entering Lanka. 
train_hindifullfemale_02443| Mala started shouting to the top of her voice, Mother! This man is killing me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02444| Tenaliraman in a commanding tone, I told you not to hinder me in the middle. 
train_hindifullfemale_02445| Now keep quiet close your mouth and listen completely, jumping like an ape, Tenaliraman took out a lighted wisp hanging from the wall. 
train_hindifullfemale_02446| Hanuman returning from the Ashoka garden after visiting Seetha started torching Lanka and its men like this. 
train_hindifullfemale_02447| Saying this he gave fire to Mala's clothes and ignited almost all the clothes and inflammables in the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_02448| While Mala was attempting to extinguish fire on her clothes, Tenaliraman repeated beating her all over stating that was how Hanuman thumped the demons in Lanka. 
train_hindifullfemale_02449| Mala other than shouting loudly and protecting her from the fire could not do anything. 
train_hindifullfemale_02450| Few seconds later, after lighting all the household material, Tenaliraman coolly went to the backyard. 
train_hindifullfemale_02451| He stood near the well, this is how Hanuman put out the fire set to his tail by the demons and started taking bath drawing water from the well. 
train_hindifullfemale_02452| Looking at the house in fire, Kanchana Mala went astray and ran out of the house like a mad woman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02453| Tenaliraman's sarcastic comments irked her further more, Who else can narrate Ramayana so lively Kanchana Mala, did you enjoy that? 
train_hindifullfemale_02454| Cursing, yelling, screaming Kanchana Mala said, fraud, cheat, he said he will recite Ramayana for me and set the house on fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_02455| With disturbed clothes and hair, she ran to the local Court of Law, and approached the judge. 
train_hindifullfemale_02456| She sought justice from the judge explaining the whole episode. 
train_hindifullfemale_02457| Meanwhile, Tenaliraman reached there without any tension appearing on his face. 
train_hindifullfemale_02458| The Judge questioned Tenaliraman, What is your answer to her allegations? 
train_hindifullfemale_02459| Tenaliraman folded hands at the Judge and appealed, Your Majesty! I do not bear any fault with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02460| It was she, who wished to witness a lively Ramayana recital to her satisfaction. 
train_hindifullfemale_02461| Describing all the past and present deeds of Kanchana Mala, Tenaliraman said, Mr Justice! I believe I am not at fault. 
train_hindifullfemale_02462| In case the honorable court finds any, I am ready to take the punishment. 
train_hindifullfemale_02463| The Judge understood that it was the wicked and proud nature of Kanchana Mala, which brought her to this turn of life. 
train_hindifullfemale_02464| He scolded her for cheating and humiliating scholars and learned persons in the name of Ramayana recital and rewards. 
train_hindifullfemale_02465| The judgement made it clear that Tenaliraman did not have any fault to punish and freed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02466| In addition to this, the verdict released all the learned men who were serving her as servants and slaves. 
train_hindifullfemale_02467| Tenaliraman received all the appreciations from the people of the town. 
train_hindifullfemale_02468| Tenaliraman Wins the War Before Drawing Swords! 
train_hindifullfemale_02469| Sastry was a renowned scholar in reasoning, logic, and grammar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02470| A wish lied in his heart to compete with eight scholars in VijayaNagar of Sri Krishna Deva Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02471| The wish strengthened with the passage of time. 
train_hindifullfemale_02472| With the desire in him, he appeared before the King Rayar, one day when he was in his usual literary sessions with the eight jewels of his court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02473| Hey King of Kings, Sastry presented salutations to Rayar, You are the beacon of the Vijaya Nagar Empire! 
train_hindifullfemale_02474| Your pleasant looks, poetry, literature and composition are flourishing in this region. 
train_hindifullfemale_02475| I bow to you with all respects. 
train_hindifullfemale_02476| Sastry continued, The hear and say about the eight scholars in your Vijayanagar, their command over various divisions of literature. 
train_hindifullfemale_02477| They all are reputed and their names are uttered with respect in the scholars and learned circles. 
train_hindifullfemale_02478| I seek your kind permission to question them and know about their efficiency in their concerned arenas. 
train_hindifullfemale_02479| King Rayar on listening to the humble request of the visiting intellectual, Dear learned person! 
train_hindifullfemale_02480| I too carry a thought to know the standards and excellence of our eight scholars. 
train_hindifullfemale_02481| I would be happy if that wish is accomplished through you Sastry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02482| You attend the court tomorrow and let there be a professional competition. 
train_hindifullfemale_02483| Rayar ordered his courtiers to arrange a guest accommodation to the visitor. 
train_hindifullfemale_02484| Satisfied Sastry presenting salutations to the king again and left Vijayanagar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02485| The next day, Sastry presented himself in the court with all preparation. 
train_hindifullfemale_02486| All eight scholars including Tenali raman besides full house attendance had turned up to watch the competition. 
train_hindifullfemale_02487| All the seven among the eight scholars were tensed with the reputation they heard about Sastry about his command and expertise in logic, reasoning, and grammar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02488| Sastry's name is taken with scare and respect, as he defeated those personalities who were graded to be aces in that division of literature. 
train_hindifullfemale_02489| All the seven were nervous thinking whether there is a possibility of winning the visiting scholar or not. 
train_hindifullfemale_02490| Sastry was sitting in all comfort, confidence and the seven of the eight scholars were worried. 
train_hindifullfemale_02491| Tenaliraman was seated in all ease and pleasant. 
train_hindifullfemale_02492| After salutations to the King Rayar and taking his permission Tenali raman started speaking. 
train_hindifullfemale_02493| Mr Sastry! Are you good in poetry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02494| Sastry thinking that as an insult to him was about to enrage on Tenaliraman . 
train_hindifullfemale_02495| However, recollecting that he is present in the royal court of King Rayar stopped himself from doing so. 
train_hindifullfemale_02496| Gazing Tenaliraman top to bottom sarcastically said, Do you think that I am no good at that stupid, verses? 
train_hindifullfemale_02497| Do you consider even that a scholarship? 
train_hindifullfemale_02498| Instantly replied Tenaliraman, That was good to know Mr Sastry that you are good in stupid poetry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02499| We understood that very well with your words, So nice of you. 
train_hindifullfemale_02500| Sastry questioned, Tenaliraman, are there two categories as stupid poetry and bright poetry? 
train_hindifullfemale_02501| That was your statement, Sastry! Tenaliraman bounced back, you asked me whether I think you are no good in stupid verses. 
train_hindifullfemale_02502| That's all right, Let us keep that aside for now, I request you to keep us informed what are you scholar in? 
train_hindifullfemale_02503| I am reputed for my scholarship in logic and grammar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02504| On both the subjects I have excellent command, replied Sastry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02505| Tenaliraman innocently said, Mr Sastry! For quite some time, I have a doubt in a grammar sequence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02506| Can you clarify, if I ask you that? 
train_hindifullfemale_02507| Sure! Sastry answered with all pride and proud filled tone, you do not have to hesitate any more. 
train_hindifullfemale_02508| What is the grammatical rule and theory to be followed for a word, Thriyambaka Tenaliraman furnished his suspicion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02509| Sastry moved his body as if he was in laughter within. 
train_hindifullfemale_02510| Later, he said that is that a doubt? 
train_hindifullfemale_02511| Do not you know even that? 
train_hindifullfemale_02512| This is for combining two meaningful words into one. 
train_hindifullfemale_02513| God! How is that you are placed so high without knowing such a common thing? Strange! commented Sastry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02514| Hey! Is that all? Tenaliraman was ready for another bout of sarcasm. 
train_hindifullfemale_02515| If this is what you know, and can define then your scholarship is like a dead wood. 
train_hindifullfemale_02516| When the two were about to get into the actual and real round of debate and discussion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02517| King Rayar stopped them and adjourned the competitive session for the next day, as he was to take care of administrative and other affairs. 
train_hindifullfemale_02518| News spread in the city like wildfire that Tenaliraman and Sastry are about to have a literary war in the VijayaNagar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02519| The next day enthusiasts, scholars, poets, composers and others flooded into the galleries of the court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02520| Almost all the distinguished personalities of VijayaNagar including the visitor Sastry arrived. 
train_hindifullfemale_02521| King Rayar entered the court and occupied the royal throne. 
train_hindifullfemale_02522| All those present in the court saluted the King and took their respective seats. 
train_hindifullfemale_02523| Tenaliraman was not seen, and noticing this Sastry grinned within. 
train_hindifullfemale_02524| Sastry thought Tenaliraman was scared and was not present. 
train_hindifullfemale_02525| Just then, Tenaliraman carrying something fastened in a nice cloth entered in a hurry and sat after saluting the King and the court. 
train_hindifullfemale_02526| Those present in the galleries whispered among them looking at Tenaliraman surprised. 
train_hindifullfemale_02527| After the King waved for continuation of the debate and discussion, Sastry questioned, Tenaliraman can I know what is the title of the book you carry? 
train_hindifullfemale_02528| Tenaliraman not hesitating a moment replied, This is king of standard books titled, Thilakashta Mahisha Bandhanam. 
train_hindifullfemale_02529| Sastry puzzled on hearing such title, curiously he leaned forward and repeated, What? Thilakashta Mahisha Bandhanam? 
train_hindifullfemale_02530| Yes! Mr Sastry! Tenaliraman said, Thilakashta Mahisha Bandhanam! Haven't you read this book earlier? 
train_hindifullfemale_02531| Presuming that this standard book would be helpful for our debate and discussion, I brought this along. 
train_hindifullfemale_02532| Sastry could not figure out what to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_02533| First, he never knew that such books of standards existed, secondly, Tenaliraman brought that along with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02534| What to do if he countered my argument and presented one or the other citations from the book in support of his counter argument? 
train_hindifullfemale_02535| I will be closed and my skills and expertise, command would never be respected again. 
train_hindifullfemale_02536| Sastry thought for a while and decided to do something. 
train_hindifullfemale_02537| Turning towards the King Rayar he said, My Lord! 
train_hindifullfemale_02538| Tenaliraman brought Thilakashta Mahisha Bandhanam with him to standardize his argument and counter argument in the session. 
train_hindifullfemale_02539| That being the case, I should also bring some standard books to support my logic and reasoning. 
train_hindifullfemale_02540| If the King kindly grant me permission to bring those from my guest accommodation, I would return immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_02541| King Rayar acceded his plea and consented, It is alright, proceed. 
train_hindifullfemale_02542| Sastry threw himself out of the court like a whirlwind. 
train_hindifullfemale_02543| Time was passing by and Sastry did not return. 
train_hindifullfemale_02544| Rayar was compelled to postpone the session for the next day, as the session cannot continue without the competitor's presence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02545| The next morning, again the court was waiting for Sastry, He never appeared. 
train_hindifullfemale_02546| King Rayar ordered his soldiers to verify and inform the court about the disappearance of Sastry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02547| Soldiers returned like a ball hit to the wall and explained that Sastry in the dark of the night went away with his luggage. 
train_hindifullfemale_02548| Probably this could be the result of the realization that, he is definite to lose in the debate and discussion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02549| From protecting himself from the humiliation, Sastry should have left not informing anyone. 
train_hindifullfemale_02550| The total presence in the VijayaNagar including King Rayar could not stop getting into laughter. 
train_hindifullfemale_02551| Looking appraisingly at Tenaliraman, Rayar said it was an excellent performance. 
train_hindifullfemale_02552| Rayar asked, tenali raman to Recite to the court some good contents of the book you brought along, Thilakashta Mahisha Bandhanam. 
train_hindifullfemale_02553| Tenaliraman said, with all due respects to the King, is that you also mistook this bundle to be a book? saying this he opened the bundle. 
train_hindifullfemale_02554| Again there was hilarity in the court, as it was not a book, it was a tender Sesamum plant tied with reign rope for buffalos. 
train_hindifullfemale_02555| Both were fastened in a nice cloth. 
train_hindifullfemale_02556| Looking at the contents of the bundle, there was amusement for the courtiers and onlookers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02557| Tenaliraman explained, Thilakashta means a Sesamum plant and Mahisha Bandhanam, a rope used for tying a buffalo, both put together, Thilakashta Mahisha Bandhanam. 
train_hindifullfemale_02558| That is all, No standards and no books. 
train_hindifullfemale_02559| Sastry fell into dilemma on hearing this name, he did not try to take the title and think. 
train_hindifullfemale_02560| In all confusion, he fled the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_02561| King Sri Krishna Deva Rayar appreciated the intellect of Tenaliraman and felicitated him for protecting the reputation of VijayaNagar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02562| That was how, Tenaliraman won the battle long before drawing any sword! 
train_hindifullfemale_02563| This is the story about how Tenaliraman attempts to turn a dog into a cow! 
train_hindifullfemale_02564| The first rays of Sun were spreading on the world driving away all the evil and darkness from it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02565| Just then King Rayar woke from deep sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_02566| Yawning he came out of his palace room and clapped calling, who is there? 
train_hindifullfemale_02567| Running came a soldier, Yes My Lord! bowing his head to the King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02568| Go right away and bring the barber along ordered Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02569| Taking the instruction, soldier left saluting the King. 
train_hindifullfemale_02570| Rayar re entered his room and just rested in the easy chair in there. 
train_hindifullfemale_02571| Immediately he went into sound sleep again. 
train_hindifullfemale_02572| The barber rushed in on hearing the call of King Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02573| Eventually, he slowly entered the room of the king to find Rayar sleeping in the armchair. 
train_hindifullfemale_02574| Sensing the King to be too tired the barber never wanted to wake him up. 
train_hindifullfemale_02575| Putting all his experience and expertise, barber completed his job shaving the beard and cutting hair. 
train_hindifullfemale_02576| Finishing his work barber left the place in all silence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02577| After sometime, Rayar opened his eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02578| He did not find the barber waiting by the door. 
train_hindifullfemale_02579| Angrily he clapped for the attendant and shouted at him to bring the barber in a moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_02580| Slowly he got off the armchair and casually put his hand on the chin, Surprise! It was freshly done. 
train_hindifullfemale_02581| Rayar grew suspicious and walked in front of the mirror and looked at his image in there. 
train_hindifullfemale_02582| The hair was cleanly cut and beard was neatly shaved. 
train_hindifullfemale_02583| Meanwhile the attendant brought the barber before him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02584| Rayar was impressed about the barber's job and appreciated him, You Barber! I am satisfied with your job. 
train_hindifullfemale_02585| I wish to bestow a boon, go on ask one I will accomplish. 
train_hindifullfemale_02586| Hesitantly barber presented his good old desire, Since long, My Lord, I carry a wish to become a Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_02587| Kindly bless me with this, I do not need any thing, as my family and me do not have anything short with the your Lord's mercy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02588| Rayar was stunned to know barber's desire. 
train_hindifullfemale_02589| However, he assured, This is not any big boon, tomorrow itself your wish will be fulfilled. 
train_hindifullfemale_02590| He waved the barber to leave, and summoned for some Brahmins. 
train_hindifullfemale_02591| Dear Brahmins! I promised the barber to transform him as a Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_02592| You should do it with all your knowledge and keep my word. 
train_hindifullfemale_02593| All of you will be rewarded suitably, Rayar ordered. 
train_hindifullfemale_02594| On hearing the sound of rewarded Brahmins were lured and told the king, As you wish My Lord! We will transform the barber into a Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_02595| The news of barber turning a Brahmin spread in the city and all the Brahmin community. 
train_hindifullfemale_02596| They whimpered silently, because if they speak louder the King might know of it and they would face punishment. 
train_hindifullfemale_02597| They thought, it is not fair for the King Rayar to order so for transforming the barber into a Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_02598| This might give way for many others to long for the wish, This is against dharma. 
train_hindifullfemale_02599| Thinking long in vain what to do, they approached Tenaliraman seeking a solution. 
train_hindifullfemale_02600| Understanding the whole episode, Tenaliraman tried to inject some confidence into the members of the Brahmin community. 
train_hindifullfemale_02601| He told them, All of you have some peace and rest. 
train_hindifullfemale_02602| I will try my best to avert this extreme incident from happening. 
train_hindifullfemale_02603| The next morning, the Brahmins who were ordered on to the job took the barber to the Coast of Suvarna Mukhi River. 
train_hindifullfemale_02604| There they started chanting some mantras standing around him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02605| King Sri Krishna Deva Rayar was watching the performance sitting at a distance and was supervising what was happening. 
train_hindifullfemale_02606| At the same time, a little far from this place, Tenaliraman was chanting something or the other standing by the side of a black dog. 
train_hindifullfemale_02607| He was pretending to ignore what was taking place near the place. 
train_hindifullfemale_02608| While the Brahmins continued chanting the mantras, Rayar slowly walked close to Tenaliraman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02609| Rayar asked, Tenaliraman! What are you doing to the dog? 
train_hindifullfemale_02610| With all natural submission Tenaliraman told, I am transforming this black dog into a white cow. 
train_hindifullfemale_02611| Rayar laughing sarcastically, Rama how can this black dog, perhaps, any dog turn into a white cow ? 
train_hindifullfemale_02612| Even if you chant some mantras after giving it a dip in the holy river it is not possible. 
train_hindifullfemale_02613| Innocently Tenaliraman said, King of Kings! Kindly forgive me for my foolishness. 
train_hindifullfemale_02614| But, why can't this black dog be turned into a white cow, when a barber is being transformed into a Brahmin? 
train_hindifullfemale_02615| King Rayar stopped laughing and started to think. 
train_hindifullfemale_02616| He understood that Tenaliraman was doing this to open his eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02617| Immediately he called the barber and told him, barber, it is not possible to turn you as a Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_02618| Leaving this desire ask for another one. 
train_hindifullfemale_02619| The barber submissively saluted, Master! I am happy with your kindness, I do not need anything and left for home. 
train_hindifullfemale_02620| Rayar as usual, felicitated Tenaliraman for opening his eyes and protecting from doing things against the Dharma. 
train_hindifullfemale_02621| Story of Tenaliraman's prostrate adoration to donkeys. 
train_hindifullfemale_02622| There was the royal teacher to the King Sri Krishna Deva Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02623| He was a Vaishnavite by practice and was having a defiant opinion and behaviour. 
train_hindifullfemale_02624| While moving out, he used to cover his head and face with his upper garment to avoid seeing others in the town unnecessarily. 
train_hindifullfemale_02625| People watching Teacher doing this time and again titled him unofficially as stupid ritual. 
train_hindifullfemale_02626| The other learned persons were finding ways to teach a lesson to Teacher. 
train_hindifullfemale_02627| They could not decide upon how and when to make tit for tat. 
train_hindifullfemale_02628| The scare spread among them was that Teacher is the royal teacher to the King Rayar and his family. 
train_hindifullfemale_02629| If something goes wrong and kindles fury in the King, who should face it? 
train_hindifullfemale_02630| With all these thoughts, they started searching for an efficient person to do this job for them. 
train_hindifullfemale_02631| Their search ended after touring and scanning through all the faces in the kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_02632| That face belonged to Tenaliraman . 
train_hindifullfemale_02633| In a group, all the learned people went to Tenaliraman's residence to see him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02634| Tenaliraman was little surprised to see all of them together at his threshold. 
train_hindifullfemale_02635| Clipping some smiles on his lips, Tenaliraman invited them folding hands to the scholar's battalion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02636| He invited them as Welcome to you the learned personalities of the capital city. 
train_hindifullfemale_02637| It is my pleasure to see you all together. 
train_hindifullfemale_02638| One among the scholars took the initiative to explain the problem that was boggling their minds, Tenaliraman! We are all here to discuss a problem with you seeking a solution. 
train_hindifullfemale_02639| The royal teacher is behaving beyond limits and is humiliating others regularly. 
train_hindifullfemale_02640| This might end up elsewhere, if he is not taught a right lesson. 
train_hindifullfemale_02641| We all strongly believe that you are the right man who can do it in a sensible way. 
train_hindifullfemale_02642| Please do not dishearten us. 
train_hindifullfemale_02643| You should take this matter up. 
train_hindifullfemale_02644| Another scholar also supported the previous one. 
train_hindifullfemale_02645| You should plunge into action for a correct solution to this problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_02646| Tenaliraman thought for a while, when all the other members of the group were coming out with one or the other statement against Teacher. 
train_hindifullfemale_02647| Tenaliraman assured them, All of you had put a heavy and burdensome job on my shoulders. 
train_hindifullfemale_02648| Let me see what can I do about this. 
train_hindifullfemale_02649| This is all the blessings of the God. 
train_hindifullfemale_02650| You do not worry; I will take care of Teacher and his religious pride. 
train_hindifullfemale_02651| Though Tenaliraman personally watched Teacher's bad behaviour towards other religions and practices, he could not do anything. 
train_hindifullfemale_02652| Now, the time has come. Nevertheless, how to go about this? 
train_hindifullfemale_02653| What would happen if King Rayar is irked on taking Teacher to task? 
train_hindifullfemale_02654| Tenaliraman was waiting for the right time. 
train_hindifullfemale_02655| While all this was going on, King Rayar learnt about the indecent mannerism of Teacher. 
train_hindifullfemale_02656| He was hurt with the behaviour of Teacher and thought that if this continued, it might give way to communal differences in the kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_02657| Thinking so, Rayar summoned Tenaliraman to his private chamber in the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_02658| Tenaliraman was present before the King as quickly as possible after hearing the call. 
train_hindifullfemale_02659| Tenaliraman! King Rayar said in a low tone, I wish to discuss an important issue with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_02660| Yes My Lord replied Tenaliraman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02661| This is a matter that should be handled completely undercover. 
train_hindifullfemale_02662| I thought you are efficient to handle this matter. 
train_hindifullfemale_02663| I am assigning this job to you, said rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_02664| Yes my king, every word of yours is an order for me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02665| It came to my knowledge that the royal teacher is humiliating Smarthas. 
train_hindifullfemale_02666| I also noted that people are disgusted with him for this, in fact some of the courtiers also pleaded me to handle him and stop him from doing so. 
train_hindifullfemale_02667| He is my family master and an elderly person. 
train_hindifullfemale_02668| What and how should I tell him to correct his deeds? Now, it is up to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_02669| Think wise and do something to check him from continuing with this, Rayar ordered Tenaliraman. 
train_hindifullfemale_02670| Tenaliraman promised the King, My Lord! I will do my best to solve the problem and bring some change in the ideology of Teacher. 
train_hindifullfemale_02671| Leaving the palace, Tenaliraman was overwhelmed with joy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02672| He was waiting for a right opportunity and it has come this way in the form of King's order. 
train_hindifullfemale_02673| The next morning Tenaliraman went to see teacher. 
train_hindifullfemale_02674| No sooner Tenaliraman approached the main gate, he could see Teacher coming out of the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_02675| While approaching the gate, Teacher watching Tenaliraman standing there took his upper garment and started covering his face. 
train_hindifullfemale_02676| Tenaliraman immediately said in a loud tone, Excuse me Master! I am a beloved disciple. 
train_hindifullfemale_02677| Why is that you are covering your face on seeing me? 
train_hindifullfemale_02678| Teacher replied, Tenaliraman! I will tell you a secret, just because you are my beloved disciple. 
train_hindifullfemale_02679| Other cultures are sin filled ones. 
train_hindifullfemale_02680| Anyone who sees those people will be born as a donkey in his or her next birth. 
train_hindifullfemale_02681| That is why I protect myself by covering my face from attracting the sin of seeing others. 
train_hindifullfemale_02682| Keep this to yourself and do not reveal anywhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_02683| Tenaliraman was more humble then, My dear master! You know me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02684| If I hear something, that totally remains within me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02685| That will not come out even after my death. 
train_hindifullfemale_02686| You do not have to worry about this. 
train_hindifullfemale_02687| Now, if you permit me I will take leave. 
train_hindifullfemale_02688| Go ahead, Teacher sent him off. 
train_hindifullfemale_02689| On way home, Tenaliraman was almost jumping with joy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02690| All these days he was breaking his head to find ways to teach a lesson. 
train_hindifullfemale_02691| That was a fine day, because Teacher himself presented him with an excellent opportunity. 
train_hindifullfemale_02692| Ten days passed off coolly, with Tenaliraman waiting for an opportunity. 
train_hindifullfemale_02693| On the eleventh day, King Rayar along with the Teacher, eight scholars and other scholars, visited a garden on the outskirts of the city as a part of the king's relaxing routines. 
train_hindifullfemale_02694| The day was spent off in a pleasurable manner. 
train_hindifullfemale_02695| While all of them were returning a herd of donkeys were seen coming in the opposite direction. 
train_hindifullfemale_02696| Immediately, Tenaliraman ran from behind the King and started paying prostrate homage to the donkeys falling on the ground before the herd. 
train_hindifullfemale_02697| King Rayar was completely surprised with his behaviour. 
train_hindifullfemale_02698| He shouted, Tenaliraman have you gone mad? 
train_hindifullfemale_02699| Why are you saluting those donkeys? 
train_hindifullfemale_02700| My Lord! Kindly pardon me, I did not go mad or crazy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02701| This donkey is Teacher's brother in law. 
train_hindifullfemale_02702| That one his grandfather, that stout one is his maternal uncle and the one with those spots is Teacher's father. 
train_hindifullfemale_02703| Tenaliraman continued, I am blessed to see all these persons reborn as donkeys. 
train_hindifullfemale_02704| They are here in this form for the sin of looking at other religious and cultural followers in their previous birth. 
train_hindifullfemale_02705| I am pleased to see all of them together. 
train_hindifullfemale_02706| Please My King do not mistake me, I am not lying. 
train_hindifullfemale_02707| You can confirm this with the respected royal Teacher. 
train_hindifullfemale_02708| He does practice to cover his face to protect himself from this happening. 
train_hindifullfemale_02709| King Rayar looked at Teacher, who already had hung his chin down in shame. 
train_hindifullfemale_02710| Since then, Teacher stopped both humiliating and covering his face on looking at people, belonging to other traditions and cultures. 
train_hindifullfemale_02711| The King felicitated Tenaliraman with a great gift in his private chamber for teaching the royal master the right lesson. 
train_hindifullfemale_02712| About the foolish Lion and the clever Rabbit. 
train_hindifullfemale_02713| Once upon a time there lived a ferocious lion in the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_02714| It was a greedy lion and started killing animals in the forest indiscriminately. 
train_hindifullfemale_02715| Seeing this, the animals gathered and decided to approach the lion with the offer of one animal per day. 
train_hindifullfemale_02716| One animal of each species volunteering itself to be eaten by the lion everyday. 
train_hindifullfemale_02717| So every day it was the turn of one of the animals and in the end came the rabbit's turn. 
train_hindifullfemale_02718| The rabbits chose an old rabbit among them. 
train_hindifullfemale_02719| The rabbit was wise and old. 
train_hindifullfemale_02720| It took its own sweet time to go to the Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02721| The Lion was getting impatient on not seeing any animal come by and swore to kill all animals the next day. 
train_hindifullfemale_02722| The rabbit then strode along to the Lion by sunset. 
train_hindifullfemale_02723| The Lion was angry at him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02724| But the wise rabbit was calm and slowly told the Lion that it was not his fault. 
train_hindifullfemale_02725| He told the Lion that a group of rabbits were coming to him for the day when on the way, an angry Lion attacked them all and ate all rabbits but himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_02726| Somehow he escaped to reach safety, the rabbit said. 
train_hindifullfemale_02727| He said that the other Lion was challenging the supremacy of his Lordship the Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02728| The Lion was naturally very enraged and asked to be taken to the location of the other Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02729| The wise rabbit agreed and led the Lion towards a deep well filled with water. 
train_hindifullfemale_02730| Then he showed the Lion his reflection in the water of the well. 
train_hindifullfemale_02731| The Lion was furious and started growling and naturally its image in the water, the other Lion was also equally angry. 
train_hindifullfemale_02732| Then the Lion jumped into the water at the other Lion to attack it, and so lost its life in the well. 
train_hindifullfemale_02733| Thus the wise rabbit saved the forest and its inhabitants from the proud Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02734| Part one of loss of friends story. 
train_hindifullfemale_02735| Once upon a time, a king ruled the city state in the south of India. 
train_hindifullfemale_02736| He had three witless sons who became a matter of endless worry for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02737| Realizing that his sons had no interest in learning, the king summoned his ministers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02738| He said You know I am not happy with my sons. 
train_hindifullfemale_02739| According to men of learning an unborn son and a stillborn son are better than a son who is a dimwit. 
train_hindifullfemale_02740| What good is a barren cow? A son who is stupid will bring dishonour to his father. 
train_hindifullfemale_02741| How can I make them fit to be my successors? I turn to you for advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_02742| One of the ministers suggested the name of Vishnu Sharman, a great scholar enjoying the respect of hundreds of his disciples. 
train_hindifullfemale_02743| He is the most competent person to tutor your children. 
train_hindifullfemale_02744| Entrust them to his care and very soon you will see the change. 
train_hindifullfemale_02745| The king summoned Vishnu Sharman and pleaded with him, venerable scholar, take pity on me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02746| Please train my sons into great scholars and I will make you the lord of a hundred villages. 
train_hindifullfemale_02747| Vishnu Sharman said king, listen to my pledge. 
train_hindifullfemale_02748| Hundred villages do not tempt me to vend learning. 
train_hindifullfemale_02749| Count six months from today. 
train_hindifullfemale_02750| If I do not make your children great scholars, you can ask me to change my name. 
train_hindifullfemale_02751| The king immediately called his sons and handed them to the care of the learned man. 
train_hindifullfemale_02752| Sharman took them to his monastery where he started teaching them the five strategies. 
train_hindifullfemale_02753| Keeping his word, he finished the task the king entrusted him with, in six months. 
train_hindifullfemale_02754| Since then, he became popular all over the world as children's guide in solving problems of life. 
train_hindifullfemale_02755| Now begins the Loss of Friends, first of the five strategies series. 
train_hindifullfemale_02756| These are stories that figure in a dialogue between two jackals named Ram and Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_02757| Long, long ago, a Merchant lived in a town in the south of India. 
train_hindifullfemale_02758| As he was resting on his bed one day it struck him that money was the axis of the world. 
train_hindifullfemale_02759| The more he had of it the more he would be powerful. 
train_hindifullfemale_02760| Even enemies seek the friendship of a rich man, he told himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_02761| The old become young if they have riches and the young become old if they do not have wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_02762| Business is one of the six ways that help man with mass wealth, was his logic. 
train_hindifullfemale_02763| Mobilizing all his wares, Merchant set out on an auspicious day for Mathura in search of markets for his goods. 
train_hindifullfemale_02764| He began his travel in a gaily decorated cart drawn by two bullocks. 
train_hindifullfemale_02765| On the way, tired of the long haul, one of the bullocks collapsed in the middle of a jungle near river Jamuna. 
train_hindifullfemale_02766| But the merchant continued his journey asking some of his servants to take care of the animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_02767| But the servants abandoned the bullock soon after their master had left. 
train_hindifullfemale_02768| Joining him later, they told him that the bullock was dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_02769| In fact, the Bullock was not dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_02770| Feeding on the abundant fresh and tender grass in the forest he regained his strength. 
train_hindifullfemale_02771| He then began to merrily explore the jungle, dancing and singing in joy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02772| In the same forest lived a lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02773| He is the king of that forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_02774| Bullock, content with his new life in the jungle would waltz and sing uproariously with joy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02775| One day, Lion and other animals were drinking water in the Jamuna when the lion heard the frightening bellow of the bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_02776| In panic, the lion withdrew into the forest and sat deeply lost in thought and surrounded by other animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_02777| Sensing the predicament of their king, two jackals, Ram and Sham, sons of two dismissed ministers, were clueless as to what had happened to their king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02778| What could have happened to the lord of the forest, asked Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_02779| Why should we poke our nose into affairs that are not our concern? Haven't you heard the story of the monkey which pulled out the wedge from the log, asked Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_02780| Sounds interesting, Please tell me what happened to the monkey, pleaded Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_02781| Now, listen, said Sham and began narrating the story of the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_02782| The monkey and The Wedge. 
train_hindifullfemale_02783| A merchant once started building a temple in the middle of his garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_02784| Many masons and carpenters were working for the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_02785| They took time off every day to go to the town for their lunch. 
train_hindifullfemale_02786| One day, when the workers left for lunch a batch of monkey landed at the temple site. 
train_hindifullfemale_02787| They began playing with whatever caught their fancy. 
train_hindifullfemale_02788| One of the monkey saw a partly sawed log of wood and a wedge fixed in it so that it does not close up. 
train_hindifullfemale_02789| Curious to know what it is, the monkey began furiously tugging at the wedge. 
train_hindifullfemale_02790| At last the wedge came off, not before trapping the legs of the monkey into the rift of the log. 
train_hindifullfemale_02791| Very soon, not able to get his legs out of the closed wood, the monkey died. 
train_hindifullfemale_02792| Therefore, Ram told Sham, it is not wise to poke our nose into affairs that are not our concern. 
train_hindifullfemale_02793| We have a food store. 
train_hindifullfemale_02794| Why should we bother ourselves about this lion?. 
train_hindifullfemale_02795| Sham retorted, Food is not the centre of our life. 
train_hindifullfemale_02796| The elders have said that wise men seek the help of the king to help friends and harm foes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02797| There are hundred ways of collecting food. 
train_hindifullfemale_02798| What matters is a life full of learning, courage and wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_02799| If living somehow is the goal, even the crow lives long eating leftovers. 
train_hindifullfemale_02800| True, but we are not ministers any more. 
train_hindifullfemale_02801| The elders have always said that the stupid person who offers uncalled advice to the king invites not only insult but also deceit, said Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_02802| No, Sham said, anyone who serves the king with devotion is bound to earn his favour in the long run. 
train_hindifullfemale_02803| The one who does not remains where he is. 
train_hindifullfemale_02804| Those who understand why the king is angry or generous will one day rise in office. 
train_hindifullfemale_02805| It is necessary to be in the good books of the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02806| Okay, what do you want to do now? asked Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_02807| You know the king is scared now. 
train_hindifullfemale_02808| We will ask him what frightens him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02809| Using the six ways of diplomacy get close to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02810| How do you know the king is scared?. 
train_hindifullfemale_02811| Changes in posture, signs, pace, actions, conversation, looks and expression indicate the working of the mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_02812| I will approach the fear struck king today and with my intelligence, I will dispel his fear and once again become his minister, said Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_02813| How can you do it when you do not know principles of service? asked Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_02814| Sham told him all he knew and learnt about what makes a good and loyal servant in the service of the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02815| In that case, I wish you all good luck, said Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_02816| Taking leave of Ram, Sham then called on the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02817| Recognizing that he was the son of his old minister King Lion told his sentry to bring him into his presence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02818| Sham came down on his knees to pay respects to the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02819| We haven't seen you for a long time, the king said. 
train_hindifullfemale_02820| I do not know of what use I can be to you, my lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_02821| Yet, according to the learned, there are occasions when every person however high or low will be of use to the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02822| For generations we have served the king with devotion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02823| Yet I am out of your majesty's favour. 
train_hindifullfemale_02824| All right, competent or incompetent you are the son of our old minister. 
train_hindifullfemale_02825| Go ahead and tell me whatever you have in your mind, the king ordered Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_02826| May I ask you humbly, my lord, what made you come back from the lake without drinking water, asked Sham reluctantly. 
train_hindifullfemale_02827| Sham, haven't you heard the great and frightening sounds in the distance? I want to leave this forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_02828| The strange animal that could make such sounds ought to be as powerful as the sounds he makes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02829| Your majesty, if it is only sound that is your problem, I wish to submit that sounds are misleading. 
train_hindifullfemale_02830| I can tell you the story of a jackal, how it overcame the fear of sound. 
train_hindifullfemale_02831| Let us hear it, said the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02832| Here comes the story of a jackal and the drum. 
train_hindifullfemale_02833| A hungry jackal set out in search of food and ended up at an abandoned battlefield when he heard loud and strange sounds. 
train_hindifullfemale_02834| Scared, he thought, I must disappear from here before the man who is making these sounds gets me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02835| After a while he told himself, I must not run away like that. 
train_hindifullfemale_02836| Let me find out what really the sounds are and who is making them because whether it is fear or happiness one must know its cause. 
train_hindifullfemale_02837| Such a person will never regret his actions. 
train_hindifullfemale_02838| So, let me first look for the source of these noises. 
train_hindifullfemale_02839| Wearily, the jackal marched in the direction of the sounds and found a drum there. 
train_hindifullfemale_02840| It was this drum, which was sending the sounds, whenever the branches of the trees above, brushed against it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02841| Relieved, the jackal began playing the drum and thought that there could be food inside it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02842| The jackal entered the drum by piercing its side. 
train_hindifullfemale_02843| He was disappointed to find no food in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02844| Yet he consoled himself saying that he rid himself of the fear of sound. 
train_hindifullfemale_02845| Therefore, Sham told king Lion, your majesty should not be afraid of sounds. 
train_hindifullfemale_02846| I seek your permission to go and see what the sounds are. 
train_hindifullfemale_02847| Okay, said the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02848| Taking leave of the king, Sham proceeded in the direction of the sound. 
train_hindifullfemale_02849| The king now began worrying himself about Sham's intentions. 
train_hindifullfemale_02850| He may have a grudge against me for dismissing him once. 
train_hindifullfemale_02851| Such persons seek revenge. 
train_hindifullfemale_02852| I should not have taken him into confidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02853| Let me keep an eye on him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02854| Wise men have always maintained that it is difficult to kill even a weak man. 
train_hindifullfemale_02855| Especially one who does not easily trust others. 
train_hindifullfemale_02856| But it is easy to kill a strong man who readily trusts others, the king thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_02857| As the king kept an eye on him, Sham moved slowly towards the bullock, and found that he was after all an animal and thought, This is a good omen. 
train_hindifullfemale_02858| This will help me to get back into the good books of the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02859| Kings never follow the advice of their ministers unless they are in peril or grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_02860| Just as a healthy man never thinks of a doctor, a strong and secure king also never remembers the need for a minister. 
train_hindifullfemale_02861| Assured that what he saw was only a bullock, Sham returned to the king and told him what he saw. 
train_hindifullfemale_02862| Is it true? the king asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_02863| The king is God, and the man who lies to a king perishes. 
train_hindifullfemale_02864| He alone has the power to grant favours. 
train_hindifullfemale_02865| I believe you. 
train_hindifullfemale_02866| Great men do not harm weaker people. 
train_hindifullfemale_02867| They take on only their equals. 
train_hindifullfemale_02868| That is what is unique about brave people. 
train_hindifullfemale_02869| What your majesty says is true, Bullock is great. 
train_hindifullfemale_02870| If your lordship permits me, I will persuade him to be one of your servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_02871| All right, I am taking you back as a minister, said the king, pleased. 
train_hindifullfemale_02872| Sham at once hurried back to Bullock and told him to stop bellowing and come and meet his king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02873| But the bullock wanted to know who this Lion was. 
train_hindifullfemale_02874| What? You do not know your lord? Wait, you will know shortly the cost of this ignorance. 
train_hindifullfemale_02875| There he is, surrounded by his retinue under the banyan tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_02876| Bullock thought his days were numbered and pleaded with Sham, Sir, you seem to be a man of great wisdom and wit. 
train_hindifullfemale_02877| You alone can save me, and I can come only if you can assure me that no harm will come to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02878| Sham told the bullock to wait for the right time to meet the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02879| Returning to the king, Sham told him My lord, he is not an ordinary being. 
train_hindifullfemale_02880| He is the vehicle of Lord Shiva. 
train_hindifullfemale_02881| He told me that Lord Shiva had permitted him to feed on the tender grass in the neighbourhood of Jamuna. 
train_hindifullfemale_02882| But I told him that the forest belonged to our lion king who is the vehicle of goddess Paarvathi. 
train_hindifullfemale_02883| You are our guest, You can see our king and seek a separate space for you to graze. 
train_hindifullfemale_02884| He agreed to this plan provided he has an assurance from your majesty. 
train_hindifullfemale_02885| Yes, certainly, But I will need assurance from him in return. 
train_hindifullfemale_02886| Bring him here, the king told Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_02887| Going back to the bullock Sham advised him, You have the assurance of the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02888| But this new position should not go to your head. 
train_hindifullfemale_02889| We have to work together, That is how we can prosper. 
train_hindifullfemale_02890| Otherwise, he who does not respect anyone, however high or low, will forfeit the favour of kings, like that Chandran. 
train_hindifullfemale_02891| What about Chandran? asked Bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_02892| Chandran is the main character of the story The fall and rise of a merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_02893| In the city of Merchant, there lived a wealthy merchant named Chandran. 
train_hindifullfemale_02894| He held a great reception for his wedding attended by the king, the queen, their ministers and all the rich and influential persons in the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_02895| Present at the reception was a lowly sweeper in the royal household. 
train_hindifullfemale_02896| When Chandran saw him occupying a seat reserved for the nobles of the king, he ordered his servants to throw him out of his house. 
train_hindifullfemale_02897| Thus insulted, sweeper thought to himself, I am a poor man and so cannot give a fitting reply to such a wealthy person as Chandran. 
train_hindifullfemale_02898| I must some how see that the king stops his favours to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02899| Then he hit upon a plan to take revenge on Chandran. 
train_hindifullfemale_02900| One early morning when the king was still asleep, sweeper pretending to sweep the king's bedroom began murmuring loudly. 
train_hindifullfemale_02901| He murmured about how arrogant Chandran is! He has the cheek to lock the queen in his embrace. 
train_hindifullfemale_02902| Hearing this, the king demanded to know whether what the sweeper was murmuring is true. 
train_hindifullfemale_02903| Did Chandran embrace the queen? your majesty, I do not remember nor do I know what I was saying. 
train_hindifullfemale_02904| Because I was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling, the sweeper told the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_02905| Not satisfied with his reply the king thought that it was possible that the sweeper had seen Chandran, who had equal access to the royal household as this sweeper, embracing the queen. 
train_hindifullfemale_02906| He remembered wise men saying that men were likely to talk in their sleep about what they did, saw and desired in the day. 
train_hindifullfemale_02907| Women were chaste because men were not within reach or they were afraid of prying servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_02908| Convinced that Chandran had indeed embraced the queen, the king barred Chandran from entering the royal household. 
train_hindifullfemale_02909| The merchant began grieving his fate though he had not done any harm to the king or his relatives even in his dreams. 
train_hindifullfemale_02910| One day as Chandran was trying to enter the king's palace he was barred by the king's men. 
train_hindifullfemale_02911| Seeing this the sweeper told them, You fools, you are barring the great Chandran who has won the king's favours. 
train_hindifullfemale_02912| He is powerful, and if you stop him, you will meet with the same fate as I did at the hands of Chandran one day. 
train_hindifullfemale_02913| The merchant thought that it would do him good to make sweeper happy and win his confidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_02914| One evening he invited the sweeper for tea and presented him with expensive clothes and told him, Friend, I had never meant to insult you. 
train_hindifullfemale_02915| You had occupied a seat I had set apart for the learned. 
train_hindifullfemale_02916| Kindly pardon me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02917| Pleased, the sweeper promised to win the king's favour for Chandran again. 
train_hindifullfemale_02918| The next day, sweeper repeated the same drama of pretending to talk irrelevantly, raving that the king was eating cucumber in the rest room. 
train_hindifullfemale_02919| What nonsense are you talking? Did you ever see me doing such things? the king demanded to know. 
train_hindifullfemale_02920| No, your majesty, I do not know nor do I remember what I was saying. 
train_hindifullfemale_02921| Because I was drowsy having spent the entire night in gambling, the sweeper said. 
train_hindifullfemale_02922| The king then realized that if what the sweeper had said about him was not true what he had said about Chandran also could not be true. 
train_hindifullfemale_02923| A person like Chandran could not have done what sweeper had told him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02924| The king also found that without Chandran the affairs of the state had suffered and civic administration had come to a standstill. 
train_hindifullfemale_02925| The king immediately summoned the merchant to his palace and restored to him all the authority. 
train_hindifullfemale_02926| He had enjoyed before he fell out of king's favour. 
train_hindifullfemale_02927| Sham resumed, That is why we must know that pride goes before fall. 
train_hindifullfemale_02928| Bullock agreed, Taking him to the lion king, Sham introduced Bullock to Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02929| After exchanging pleasantries, the king asked him to relate his past and the purpose of staying in that jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_02930| On the bullock relating his story, the king said, Friend, do not be afraid. 
train_hindifullfemale_02931| I assure you that I will protect you from wild animals here because even stronger animals feel insecure here. 
train_hindifullfemale_02932| Since then, the king asked Ram and Sham to look after the affairs of the state and began happily spending his time in the company of Bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_02933| But the jackals were worried that after Bullock had become a good friend of the king, the king gave up his royal sports and pastime and became a saint. 
train_hindifullfemale_02934| The jackal twins thought, the king has stopped taking us into confidence after Bullock became his best friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_02935| He is also indifferent to his kingly duties. 
train_hindifullfemale_02936| What shall we do now? Ram said, The king may not heed our advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_02937| But it is our duty to advise him on it, if it is good for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02938| Elders have always held that, even if the king is not willing to heed good advice, it is the duty of his ministers, to offer him advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_02939| You are right, said Sham, The mistake is mine. 
train_hindifullfemale_02940| What happened to the sage and the jackal should not happen to us. 
train_hindifullfemale_02941| Ram then asked him to tell the story of the sage and the jackal. 
train_hindifullfemale_02942| Sham began telling him the story of a foolish sage and the jackal. 
train_hindifullfemale_02943| In a monastery far away from human habitation lived a saint called Deva Sharma. 
train_hindifullfemale_02944| He amassed a lot of wealth by selling clothes gifted to him by well wishers and disciples. 
train_hindifullfemale_02945| It became a burden for him to guard that wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_02946| Since he did not trust anyone, he put all his money into a bag and carried it with him wherever he went. 
train_hindifullfemale_02947| Komal, an experienced cheat, noticed Deva Sharma carrying his bag always with him and assuming that it certainly contained something valuable, began planning to snatch it from him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02948| One day, the cheat met the saint and promptly fell on his feet and said, know all, I have realized that this life is an illusion. 
train_hindifullfemale_02949| Youth is fleeting and all familial ties are like a dream. 
train_hindifullfemale_02950| Please show me the correct path that delivers me from all worldly ties. 
train_hindifullfemale_02951| Pleased with his humility, Deva Sharma said, Child, you are the blessed one who has thought of renouncing worldly pleasures. 
train_hindifullfemale_02952| Listen, however low his caste is, the person that chants Om Namahsivayah and smears holy ash on his forehead, becomes Siva himself and knows no rebirth. 
train_hindifullfemale_02953| I shall accept you as my portage but you must not enter the hermitage in the night because company is forbidden for saints. 
train_hindifullfemale_02954| After initiation, you have to live in the hut at the entrance of the monastery. 
train_hindifullfemale_02955| Komal promised the saint that he would consider every sign from him as a command and carry it out. 
train_hindifullfemale_02956| Satisfied, the saint accepted the cheat as his disciple. 
train_hindifullfemale_02957| Komal too began making Deva Sharma happy by attending to every need of his. 
train_hindifullfemale_02958| But seeing that the saint never separated the money bag from his person, Komal thought, the old man is very crafty and keeps the bag always with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02959| How can I snatch it from him? Shall I kill him? 
train_hindifullfemale_02960| As the cheat was at a loss to achieve his goal, the son of a disciple came calling on the sage. 
train_hindifullfemale_02961| The visitor invited Deva Sharma to come to his village and perform the sacred thread ceremony of his son. 
train_hindifullfemale_02962| The saint accepted the invitation and set out for the village taking Komal with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_02963| On the way, the guru and his disciple had to cross a river. 
train_hindifullfemale_02964| After bathing in the river and wanting to rest for a while, Deva Sharma took the money bag. 
train_hindifullfemale_02965| He pushed it into a quilt he was carrying and told the disciple, I have to respond to nature's call. 
train_hindifullfemale_02966| I am leaving this holy quilt of Siva here Keep an eye on it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02967| The moment the guru went out of his sight, Komal collected the bag and fled the place. 
train_hindifullfemale_02968| With great trust in his disciple, Deva Sharma decided to spend time by joining a crowd watching two well fed goats fighting ferociously. 
train_hindifullfemale_02969| As blood was running down their heads, a jackal came there to feast on the blood the two goats were shedding. 
train_hindifullfemale_02970| Deva Sharma saw the jackal entering the scene and thought that the jackal would surely die caught between the two warring goats. 
train_hindifullfemale_02971| His surmise came true and the jackal died, gored by the two goats. 
train_hindifullfemale_02972| Brooding over the demise of the jackal, Deva Sharma returned to where he had left the money bag with Komal and panicked when he found Komal missing. 
train_hindifullfemale_02973| The holy quilt was there but not the money bag in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_02974| He began wailing, trickster, what have you done? I have lost everything in this world. 
train_hindifullfemale_02975| After a vain search for the trickster, the foolish saint returned home dejected. 
train_hindifullfemale_02976| Sham asked Ram, What do you learn from this episode? You alone can tell me. 
train_hindifullfemale_02977| The sage and the jackal have none to blame except themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_02978| In a similar situation, what should we do? Sham said, Yes, I know what to do now. 
train_hindifullfemale_02979| With my cunning I will create a rift between king Lion and Bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_02980| Haven't you heard that though you cannot subdue the enemy with a volley of arrows, you can destroy him by your wit? Wait, said Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_02981| Suppose the lion king and the roving bullock come to know of your plans to separate them, get ready to meet your end. 
train_hindifullfemale_02982| My friend, you are too pessimistic. 
train_hindifullfemale_02983| When time and tide are against you, do not give up. 
train_hindifullfemale_02984| Wise men keep on trying till they succeed in getting what they want. 
train_hindifullfemale_02985| Haven't you heard the elders saying? The Goddess of Wealth favours the man who persists. 
train_hindifullfemale_02986| Pray God by all means, but put in your own effort. 
train_hindifullfemale_02987| Even if you do not succeed, you will be free of blame. 
train_hindifullfemale_02988| Ram was not convinced that Sham could create rift between the fierce lion king and the wise bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_02989| Sham told him, Here is how through cunning two crows, husband and wife, managed to save their children from a cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_02990| Every time, the wife hatched the eggs, a cobra would come and feast on the offspring. 
train_hindifullfemale_02991| The couple asked a jackal who was their friend to show them the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_02992| The jackal told the crow not to despair, for there is nothing that a trick cannot achieve. 
train_hindifullfemale_02993| That is how a crab killed a greedy crane that was preying on the fish in the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_02994| The female crow asked the jackal how the crab had killed the crane. 
train_hindifullfemale_02995| The jackal narrated the story. 
train_hindifullfemale_02996| Then the crows asked the jackal how they could get rid of the cobra that was feasting on their offspring. 
train_hindifullfemale_02997| The jackal told them to go to a big city and snatch any item of jewellery from a palace and drop it in the hollow of the tree that is the cobra's home. 
train_hindifullfemale_02998| In search of the jewellery, the king's men would reach the tree and kill the cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_02999| The crow couple flew off to a lake where the women revealing in water is the Queen. 
train_hindifullfemale_03000| Before entering water, the women left their jewellery and clothes on the waterside. 
train_hindifullfemale_03001| The female crow skilfully dived and snatched a gold necklace and began slowly flying towards the cobra's hideout. 
train_hindifullfemale_03002| The king's men who saw the crow fly off with the necklace followed the female crow and saw it dropping the necklace into the hollow of the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03003| They ran to the tree and pulling it out killed the cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_03004| That is why, Sham told Ram, elders say, that he who is wise, is stronger than the strong. 
train_hindifullfemale_03005| Sham resumed, This is how with my skills I will create a rift between Lion and Bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_03006| All right, best of luck to you, said Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_03007| One day when Lion was alone, Sham visited him and bowed to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03008| We haven't seen you for a long time, said Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03009| Of what use am I to you? 
train_hindifullfemale_03010| Yet, when your rule is breaking up, I thought I should inform you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03011| Even without asking, offer good advice to him whom you want to protect from indignity, said our elders. 
train_hindifullfemale_03012| Whatever you want to say, say it without hesitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_03013| Gathering courage, Sham said, My lord, Bullock wants to harm you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03014| Taking me into confidence, he once told me that he would kill you, become the king and make me a minister. 
train_hindifullfemale_03015| But Bullock is a trusted friend of mine. 
train_hindifullfemale_03016| Why should he think of harming me? 
train_hindifullfemale_03017| There is no loyal or disloyal servant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03018| There is no servant who does not covet power. 
train_hindifullfemale_03019| My lord, what made you to take Bullock into confidence? do not think he is a strong animal able to kill your enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_03020| This will not happen because he is a vegetarian and my lord feasts on meat. 
train_hindifullfemale_03021| It is better to get rid of him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03022| You remember I gave him the word on your advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_03023| How can I kill him who has won assurance from me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03024| My lord, according to wise men, you should not make friends with people you do not know. 
train_hindifullfemale_03025| You know how an innocent flea died for the fault of a bug. 
train_hindifullfemale_03026| Lion demanded to know the story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03027| Sham began to relate, The Bug and The Poor Flea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03028| Once upon a time a bug made for itself a small home in the folds of the milk white sheets of linen spread on the king's ornamental bed. 
train_hindifullfemale_03029| One day, the bug saw a flea drifting into the king's bedroom. 
train_hindifullfemale_03030| The bug told the flea that he had come to a wrong place. 
train_hindifullfemale_03031| It also asked him to leave before somebody noticed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03032| The flea, said, venerable sir, it is not proper for you to ask a guest to leave even if he is a wicked person. 
train_hindifullfemale_03033| You must welcome him, ask him about his health, say words that comfort him and request him to take rest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03034| That is how good hosts treat their guests. 
train_hindifullfemale_03035| Besides, I have tasted the blood of a variety of men and animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_03036| Never did I taste royal blood. 
train_hindifullfemale_03037| The king's blood is a compound of rich foods and is bound to taste rich. 
train_hindifullfemale_03038| Please permit me to relish this delicacy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03039| The flea continued, Everything we do in this world we do to slake our hunger. 
train_hindifullfemale_03040| I have come to you in search of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03041| It is not proper for you to siphon off the king's blood all alone. 
train_hindifullfemale_03042| You should share it with me also. 
train_hindifullfemale_03043| The bug told him, flea, I suck the blood of the king when he is fast asleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_03044| You are impatient, You have to wait till I finish my job. 
train_hindifullfemale_03045| After me, you can have your fill. 
train_hindifullfemale_03046| The flea agreed, Meanwhile, the king entered his bedroom to sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_03047| But the impatient flea began feasting on the king's blood even before he went to sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_03048| Stung by his bite, the king rose from his bed and asked his servants to look for what was in the bed that caused him discomfort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03049| The king's men pulled the linen off the bed and examined it closely. 
train_hindifullfemale_03050| Before they could get him, the flea sneaked into a recess of the bed. 
train_hindifullfemale_03051| The servants found the poor bug and killed him at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_03052| Sham told Lion, This is why you should kill Bullock before he could kill you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03053| He who abandons a trusted confidant and trusts an outsider will die like the sage. 
train_hindifullfemale_03054| How did he die? Lion asked him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03055| This is the story of the blue jackal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03056| There was a jackal living in a forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03057| One day, driven by hunger, he came to a nearby town in search of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03058| Seeing him, a group of mongrels began chasing and attacking him whenever possible. 
train_hindifullfemale_03059| The jackal fled in panic and entering the house of a washer man hid in a vat full of blue used for bleaching clothes. 
train_hindifullfemale_03060| When he came out, he became a blue animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03061| Thinking that he was not the jackal they chased, the mongrels dispersed. 
train_hindifullfemale_03062| The jackal came back to the forest with his body dyed in blue. 
train_hindifullfemale_03063| When the lions, tigers, panthers, wolves and other animals in the forest saw him, they took fright and ran in all directions. 
train_hindifullfemale_03064| They thought to themselves, We do not know his power and strength. 
train_hindifullfemale_03065| It is better we keep a distance from him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03066| Haven't the elders warned not to trust him whose conduct, caste and courage are not known. 
train_hindifullfemale_03067| Seeing them scared, the dyed jackal said, Why do you run away like that. 
train_hindifullfemale_03068| There is no need to fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_03069| I am a special creation of God. 
train_hindifullfemale_03070| He told me that the animals in the jungle here had no ruler and that he was nominating me as your king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03071| He named me as Sage and told me to rule all of you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03072| Therefore all of you can live safely under the umbrella of my protection. 
train_hindifullfemale_03073| All the animals in the jungle accepted him as the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03074| He in turn appointed the lion as his minister, the tiger as his chamberlain and the wolf as the gatekeeper. 
train_hindifullfemale_03075| After distributing office to the animals, the new king Sage banished all the jackals in the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03076| The lions, tigers and the wolves killed other animals and brought them as food for the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03077| Taking his share, Sage would distribute the rest of the kill among his subjects. 
train_hindifullfemale_03078| One day when the blue jackal was holding court, he heard a gang of jackals howling. 
train_hindifullfemale_03079| Thrilled by the sound of his own kind, Sage began loudly responding in his natural voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_03080| The lions and other animals immediately recognized that their king was after all a jackal and not a Godsend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03081| They at once pounced on the blue jackal and killed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03082| The moral is, Sham said, he who abandons his own folk will perish. 
train_hindifullfemale_03083| But how do I believe that Bullock has evil intentions, asked Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03084| He told me today that he would kill you tomorrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03085| If you notice him carefully tomorrow, you will find him red eyed and occupying a seat he does not deserve. 
train_hindifullfemale_03086| He would stare at you angrily. 
train_hindifullfemale_03087| If what I say comes true, it is for you what to do, said Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03088| After this meeting with the lion king, Sham went to meet Bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_03089| The bullock received him with courtesy and said, We are meeting after a long time. 
train_hindifullfemale_03090| What can I do for you? They are the blessed who are visited by friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03091| Your are right sir, But where is rest for servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03092| They have lost their freedom for the sake of money. 
train_hindifullfemale_03093| They know no sleep, no interest in food nor can they speak without fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_03094| Yet they live, Somebody has rightly compared service to a dog's life, said Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03095| Come to the point, my friend The bullock was now impatient. 
train_hindifullfemale_03096| Sham said, Sir, a minister is not supposed to give bad advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_03097| He cannot also disclose state secrets. 
train_hindifullfemale_03098| If he does, he will go to hell after his death. 
train_hindifullfemale_03099| But in the cause of your friendship, I have revealed a secret. 
train_hindifullfemale_03100| It is on my suggestion that you have taken up service in the royal household. 
train_hindifullfemale_03101| Lion has evil designs against you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03102| When we were alone, he told me he would kill you and bring happiness to everyone in the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_03103| I told the king that this was stabbing a friend in the back, Sham continued. 
train_hindifullfemale_03104| The king was angry and said that you were a vegetarian and he lived on a diet of meat. 
train_hindifullfemale_03105| So there was natural discord between you and him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03106| He said that this was enough reason for him to kill you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03107| This is a secret I have kept to myself for a long time. 
train_hindifullfemale_03108| It is now for you to do what is necessary. 
train_hindifullfemale_03109| Bullock fainted on hearing these words. 
train_hindifullfemale_03110| Recovering after some time, he said, It is truly said that a person who serves the king is like a bullock without horns. 
train_hindifullfemale_03111| It is difficult to know the mind of a king who has different ideas. 
train_hindifullfemale_03112| It is not easy to serve a king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03113| Even sages could not read the minds of kings. 
train_hindifullfemale_03114| I think some servants who were jealous of my friendship with the king must have poisoned his mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03115| Do not worry, Sham said. 
train_hindifullfemale_03116| Forget what tales the servants carried to the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03117| You can still win his favour by your sweet words. 
train_hindifullfemale_03118| This is not true, It is impossible to live with wicked people, however small they are. 
train_hindifullfemale_03119| They can always think of a hundred ways to get you in the same manner the jackal and crow trapped the camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_03120| Sounds interesting, Let me know what happened to the camel, asked Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03121| Bullock began to tell him the story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03122| The story of a camel, a jackal and the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03123| Once in a far off forest, there lived a lion named Leo served by a leopard, a jackal and a crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03124| One day they sighted a camel who lost his way. 
train_hindifullfemale_03125| Thinking the camel they saw was an unusual animal, the lion asked his assistants to find out if he was a wild animal or domestic animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03126| The crow said that the camel was a domestic animal fit to be killed and eaten. 
train_hindifullfemale_03127| Refusing to eat Camel, the lion said, I shall not kill someone who came seeking hospitality. 
train_hindifullfemale_03128| According to our elders, you cannot kill even an enemy who came trusting you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03129| He who kills so commits the sin of killing hundred Brahmins. 
train_hindifullfemale_03130| Assure him of safety and bring him to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03131| The three assistants brought the camel to the presence of the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03132| On the lion asking the camel to relate his story, Camel told him how he was part of a trade caravan and how he had lost his way. 
train_hindifullfemale_03133| The lion told the camel, Camel, why do you go back to your village and become once again a beast of burden? 
train_hindifullfemale_03134| Remain with us without any hesitation and feast on this tender grass. 
train_hindifullfemale_03135| Thereafter, the camel stayed on to live happily with the lion and his three assistants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03136| One day, the lion was locked in a battle with an elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03137| The tusker gored Leo and badly injured him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03138| He became too weak to hunt. 
train_hindifullfemale_03139| Without food he was in no position to do anything. 
train_hindifullfemale_03140| Then, the lion asked the assistants to go out and look for some animal for his meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03141| Bring the animal here, I will kill him somehow and provide food for you all, said the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03142| The leopard, the jackal, and the camel looked everywhere for an animal but could not find anyone. 
train_hindifullfemale_03143| The jackal told the crow aside. 
train_hindifullfemale_03144| Friend, what is the use of wasting time like this? We have Camel, our lord's loyal friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03145| Let us kill him and survive. 
train_hindifullfemale_03146| That is fine, Yet we cannot kill him because our lord has assured him protection, said the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03147| Leave it to me, I shall convince Leo to kill the camel, Wait here. 
train_hindifullfemale_03148| I will meet the lord and get his permission, said the jackal and left to meet the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03149| The jackal told his lord, lord, we went to every nook and corner of the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03150| We could not find a single animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03151| We are tired, weak and hungry. 
train_hindifullfemale_03152| Since my lord is also in the same condition, I humbly suggest that we make a meal of this camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_03153| Highly annoyed, the lion said, You sinner, if you repeat these words, I shall first kill you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03154| I have given him my word, How can I kill him? 
train_hindifullfemale_03155| Haven't our elders said that no gift of land or cow or food is greater than the gift of an assurance?. 
train_hindifullfemale_03156| You are right my lord, It is a sin to kill him who has your word. 
train_hindifullfemale_03157| But if the camel voluntarily offers himself as food it is no sin to accept the offer. 
train_hindifullfemale_03158| If he does not volunteer, you can kill anyone of us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03159| You are hungry and close to your end. 
train_hindifullfemale_03160| If we are not of use to you at this time what value have our lives? If anything undesirable happens to our lord, we will immolate ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_03161| This seems to be more reasonable, said the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03162| The jackal told the other two assistants, Friends, our lord is in a pitiable condition. 
train_hindifullfemale_03163| There is now no one to protect us from others. 
train_hindifullfemale_03164| Instead of aimlessly searching the forest for food, let us offer our bodies to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03165| That will deliver us from the burden of debt. 
train_hindifullfemale_03166| The servant who is witness to the helpless death of his master will go to hell. 
train_hindifullfemale_03167| After the jackal's plea, all of them called on the lion with tears in their eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_03168| What's the matter? Did you find an animal? asked the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03169| No, my lord. We searched every place, every inch of the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03170| We are not lucky, We found nothing. 
train_hindifullfemale_03171| But I request the lord to have me for his meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03172| That will mean two birds with one shot. 
train_hindifullfemale_03173| The lord will survive and I will go to heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_03174| He who lays down his life to save his lord will have no rebirth, said the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03175| It was now the turn of the jackal to show his loyalty. 
train_hindifullfemale_03176| He said, My friend, crow, Your body is too small to slake the hunger of my lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_03177| It amounts to starving him and that is a sin. 
train_hindifullfemale_03178| Get out of my way, I have to submit a plea to my lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_03179| Addressing the lion, the jackal said, Lord, I request you to have me for your meal and ensure me a place in heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_03180| The lord has rights of life and death over his servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03181| Therefore, it is no sin in exercising his rights. 
train_hindifullfemale_03182| The leopard intervened and said, You jackal, you are no great personality. 
train_hindifullfemale_03183| Let me plead with the lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_03184| Addressing Leo, the leopard said, lord, let me give away my life to save your life. 
train_hindifullfemale_03185| Please permit me to earn a permanent berth in heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_03186| My sacrifice will win fame for me on earth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03187| All this set Camel thinking, All these servants of the lord have said what they wanted to say. 
train_hindifullfemale_03188| Still, the lion did not kill anyone of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_03189| Let me also offer to be the lord's food today. 
train_hindifullfemale_03190| I am sure my friends will support me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03191| He then turned to the leopard and said, What you have said is right and proper. 
train_hindifullfemale_03192| But you are a carnivorous animal and belong to the same species as the master does. 
train_hindifullfemale_03193| How can he kill you? Let me offer myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_03194| The camel then came forward and requested the lion to have him for that day's meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03195| At once, the jackal and the leopard pounced on him tore him to pieces and all of them had a sumptuous feast. 
train_hindifullfemale_03196| As the story ended Bullock told Sham, Wicked people surround the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03197| Good men should not serve such masters. 
train_hindifullfemale_03198| I will need your advice to get out of this problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_03199| The best course is to leave the country, said Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03200| It is not wise to leave when the king is still angry. 
train_hindifullfemale_03201| He can reach me anywhere I go. 
train_hindifullfemale_03202| The only alternative I have is to go to war with the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03203| Sham was afraid that if Bullock chose to fight Lion the lion might die and that would be a disaster. 
train_hindifullfemale_03204| Let me persuade the bullock to leave the forest, he thought, Going to war is all right. 
train_hindifullfemale_03205| But how can there be a war between a servant and a king? 
train_hindifullfemale_03206| If you underestimate the strength of your enemy you will meet the same fate as the Sea met at the hands of the bird pair. 
train_hindifullfemale_03207| Curious, Sanjeeva asked, What happened to the birds? 
train_hindifullfemale_03208| This is a story about a bird pair and the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03209| Once upon a time, a pair of pheasants lived close to the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03210| They spent their time happily singing and dancing on the branches of the trees by the Sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03211| One day the female pheasant told her husband that she was expecting their baby and he must look for a safe place to lay the eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_03212| The husband said, My dear, this Seaside is enchanting and it is better to lay your eggs here. 
train_hindifullfemale_03213| The wife said, When it is full moon, the Sea tide can wash away even wild elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03214| Let us go elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_03215| Amused, the husband said, What you say is true. 
train_hindifullfemale_03216| But the Sea has no power to harm us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03217| Haven't you heard that there is no fool who could stop the flight of a bird or a fool who would enter fire recklessly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03218| Will anyone be brash enough to challenge Yama - the Lord of Death to take his life if he can? 
train_hindifullfemale_03219| You can lay your eggs here. 
train_hindifullfemale_03220| Listening to this dialogue, the Sea thought, How vain is this bird which is as small as a worm! 
train_hindifullfemale_03221| Let me drown these eggs and see what he can do. 
train_hindifullfemale_03222| After laying eggs, the female bird went in search of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03223| In her absence, the Sea sent a wave that sucked the eggs into the waters. 
train_hindifullfemale_03224| The female returned to the nest and, not finding the eggs there, told the husband, You are a fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_03225| I told you that the waves would wash away the eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_03226| Those who do not heed the good words of a friend will perish like the turtle who fell off the stick. 
train_hindifullfemale_03227| What's that turtle and what is that stick? asked the husband. 
train_hindifullfemale_03228| Once upon a time a turtle lived in a pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_03229| He had two swans, Sankat and Vikat, as good friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03230| Every day they would meet on the rim of the pond and discuss legends of yore. 
train_hindifullfemale_03231| They would disperse with sunset. 
train_hindifullfemale_03232| That year there were no rains and the water in the pond began slowly disappearing. 
train_hindifullfemale_03233| Worried, the swans told the turtle, Friend, What will happen to you? We are concerned. 
train_hindifullfemale_03234| I appreciate your interest in me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03235| There is trouble ahead. 
train_hindifullfemale_03236| Please find a way out of this crisis. But it is important that we should not give in to despair. 
train_hindifullfemale_03237| According to turtle, all good men should come to the rescue of friends and relatives in times of need. 
train_hindifullfemale_03238| Look for a stick or a rope. 
train_hindifullfemale_03239| I will hang on to it as both of you hold the two sides of the stick or rope and ferry me to safety. 
train_hindifullfemale_03240| We shall do as you say, the swans said. 
train_hindifullfemale_03241| But you have to shut your mouth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03242| Otherwise, you will crash to the ground. 
train_hindifullfemale_03243| On turtle agreeing to the plan, the swans brought a stick and asked the turtle to hold it with his teeth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03244| When everything was ready, the swans flew off with the turtle hanging from it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03245| On the way people saw this sight and exclaimed, see, how clever the birds are. 
train_hindifullfemale_03246| In trying to respond to the people, the turtle opened his mouth and fell to the ground and died. 
train_hindifullfemale_03247| The people blamed at his stupid action and dispersed. 
train_hindifullfemale_03248| The lesson is that those who do not heed the advice of their well wishers meet their end like the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_03249| Any day, the survivors are those who foresee a danger in time and those who deal with it when it comes. 
train_hindifullfemale_03250| Those who leave things to fate and believe in luck will destroy themselves like yadhava, said the female pheasant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03251| What happened to yadhava ? asked the male bird. 
train_hindifullfemale_03252| The tale of the three fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_03253| Once upon a time three fish lived in a pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_03254| Their names were Angata, Prathyutha and yadhava . 
train_hindifullfemale_03255| Some fishermen passing by the pond wondered, we have never seen this pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_03256| It seems to be full of fish, It is now evening. 
train_hindifullfemale_03257| Let us come at dawn tomorrow and bag as many fish as we can. 
train_hindifullfemale_03258| Hearing the fisherman, Angata - the one who foresees a danger in time called a meeting of all the fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_03259| He told them, Haven't you heard what the fishermen were saying? 
train_hindifullfemale_03260| We must move out of this pond tonight itself. 
train_hindifullfemale_03261| As the wise men have said weak men should flee when a strong man invades or seek refuge in a fort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03262| There is no alternative, as the fisherman will come tomorrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03263| I think we should not be here for even a moment more, said Angata. 
train_hindifullfemale_03264| That's true, I endorse your suggestion, said Prathyutha. 
train_hindifullfemale_03265| Let's go elsewhere, Those who are afraid of foreign lands and those who are bound to their soil will die in their own country. 
train_hindifullfemale_03266| He who can prosper anywhere does not die in his own land clinging to sentiment. 
train_hindifullfemale_03267| Loudly laughing, yadhava said, Your plans are not good. 
train_hindifullfemale_03268| Why should we leave this pond, ancient home of our forefathers, because the fishermen have evil intentions. 
train_hindifullfemale_03269| If it is destined, we cannot escape death even if we go elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_03270| Everything is in the hands of God. 
train_hindifullfemale_03271| You cannot dispose what he proposes. 
train_hindifullfemale_03272| Without his blessings people will die even if they have protection. 
train_hindifullfemale_03273| With his blessings nobody can kill them even if they do not have protection. 
train_hindifullfemale_03274| Unable to convince him, the other two fish left the pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_03275| Coming the next day, the fishermen took a big catch of fish in the pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_03276| Yadhava was one among them in the net. 
train_hindifullfemale_03277| The female pheasant resumed, That is why I told you that those who foresee the problem and those who deal with the problem when it arises are always victors. 
train_hindifullfemale_03278| And those who trust their luck are the losers. 
train_hindifullfemale_03279| Her husband asked, In that case do you think I am as stupid as that yadhava? 
train_hindifullfemale_03280| Wait and see what I can do. 
train_hindifullfemale_03281| I will siphon off all the water in the Sea and leave him dry. 
train_hindifullfemale_03282| Do not try to settle scores with the Sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03283| It will do no good to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03284| A weak man's anger will hurt him in the end. 
train_hindifullfemale_03285| Do not discourage me, Those who have confidence can confront stronger men. 
train_hindifullfemale_03286| Doesn't that lion who is small in size, slash the crown, of the mighty elephant? 
train_hindifullfemale_03287| Doesn't a small wick repel darkness? He who has courage is the stronger person. 
train_hindifullfemale_03288| See how I will siphon off all the water in the Sea and make him dry, said the male. 
train_hindifullfemale_03289| But hundreds of rivers flow into the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03290| Your beak is just as big as a drop of the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03291| How can you consume all the water in the Sea? Stop this tall talk, advised the female. 
train_hindifullfemale_03292| Not to despair is to win the Goddess of Wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03293| I have an iron beak. 
train_hindifullfemale_03294| I will toil day and night to siphon of all the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_03295| The wife said, Okay, if you want to engage the Sea, call all of your friends and try to do the job together. 
train_hindifullfemale_03296| When they are united, it is difficult to defeat even a band of weak men. 
train_hindifullfemale_03297| Even blades of slender grass can bind an elephant if they are woven into a rope. 
train_hindifullfemale_03298| Haven't you heard the story of how a sparrow, a woodpecker, a fly and a frog killed an elephant? 
train_hindifullfemale_03299| Let me know how they did it, asked the male pheasant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03300| The wife began telling the story of an elephant and the sparrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03301| Two sparrows, husband and wife, built a nest on a banyan tree where the female sparrow laid eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_03302| One afternoon a wild elephant came to the tree seeking shelter from the sun. 
train_hindifullfemale_03303| Unable to bear the heat, the tusker suddenly went berserk and snapped a big branch of the tree, crushing the sparrow's eggs in the nest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03304| The sparrow pair somehow escaped the fury of the elephant but the wife began crying for her eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_03305| A woodpecker, a close friend of the sparrow, heard her crying. 
train_hindifullfemale_03306| He moved by her grief asked her, Why are you crying, my friend? 
train_hindifullfemale_03307| Wise men do not grieve what is lost or what is dead or what is past. 
train_hindifullfemale_03308| That is the difference between a learned person and an unlettered man. 
train_hindifullfemale_03309| The female sparrow said, The wicked elephant has destroyed my off spring. 
train_hindifullfemale_03310| If you are a true friend of mine suggest a way to kill him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03311| In my view, he who harms a person in trouble or he who ridicules a person in sorrow deserves to be punished and he who punishes such a person has no rebirth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03312| What you say is right, said the woodpecker. 
train_hindifullfemale_03313| He is a friend who comes to your aid when you are in need. 
train_hindifullfemale_03314| Everyone tries to be friendly when you are prospering. 
train_hindifullfemale_03315| You will see how resourceful I am. 
train_hindifullfemale_03316| I have a friend who is a fly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03317| With his help we can kill the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03318| Taking the female sparrow with him, the woodpecker called on the fly and told him, This is my dearest friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03319| A wild elephant has squashed her eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_03320| You must somehow find a way to kill that elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03321| We need your help, The fly said, I have a friend who is a frog. 
train_hindifullfemale_03322| Let us go to him and seek his help also. 
train_hindifullfemale_03323| The female sparrow, the woodpecker and the fly went to the frog and narrated the entire story of the sparrow's grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_03324| The frog said, What is an elephant before a united crowd like us? Do as I tell you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03325| Fly, go to the elephant when the sun is high in the sky and hum a sweet tune into his ears. 
train_hindifullfemale_03326| When he closes his eyes in ecstasy, the woodpecker will scoop his eyes out. 
train_hindifullfemale_03327| He becomes blind and thirsty and will look for water. 
train_hindifullfemale_03328| I will go to a quicksand and begin croaking there. 
train_hindifullfemale_03329| Thinking that there is water, the elephant will come there and sink into the quicksand and die. 
train_hindifullfemale_03330| All the four played out their roles according to the frog's plan and caused the death of the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03331| At the end of the story, the female pheasant told her husband, That is how together the four friends killed the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03332| Impressed by his wife's wisdom, the husband said, Okay, we will call our friends and with their help crush the Sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03333| As their friends, the cranes, the peacocks, the cuckoos and other birds, gathered. 
train_hindifullfemale_03334| The male pheasant told them the story of how the Sea had killed their offspring and how necessary it was to drain him out. 
train_hindifullfemale_03335| At the end, he said, We cannot do this job. 
train_hindifullfemale_03336| Let us go to vulture, the most powerful of all and vehicle of Lord Vishnu, and tell him all that has happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_03337| He will be angry over what the Sea has done to his species. 
train_hindifullfemale_03338| He will surely take revenge on the Sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03339| Wailing and weeping, all the birds went to meet vulture and told him, lord, we need your help. 
train_hindifullfemale_03340| The Sea has destroyed the eggs of the pheasant pair. 
train_hindifullfemale_03341| This is a blow to all the bird community. 
train_hindifullfemale_03342| If you do not intervene, he will destroy our entire tribe. 
train_hindifullfemale_03343| Wise men have always said that one wicked person will be an inspiration to all others with evil intentions. 
train_hindifullfemale_03344| Moved by their story of grief, vulture thought to himself, These birds have a legitimate grievance. 
train_hindifullfemale_03345| I will go and punish the Sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03346| Meanwhile, an envoy from Lord Vishnu came and told vulture that the Lord had sent him as He wanted to travel to Amaravathi on a divine mission. 
train_hindifullfemale_03347| The envoy asked vulture to accompany him at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_03348| Vulture told the envoy, No, I cannot come. 
train_hindifullfemale_03349| I am not a useful servant, Let him take someone else. 
train_hindifullfemale_03350| Please convey my regards to the Lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_03351| Surprised at vulture's words, the envoy said, vulture, you have never uttered such words about the Lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_03352| Did the Lord slight you in any manner? Let me know. 
train_hindifullfemale_03353| See, this Sea, the Lord's habitat, has swallowed the eggs of the pheasant pair. 
train_hindifullfemale_03354| If the Lord does not punish the Sea for this, I shall not serve Him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03355| This is my decision and you may convey this to the Lord, said vulture. 
train_hindifullfemale_03356| Informed of vulture's pique, Vishnu told himself, vulture has reason to be annoyed with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03357| I shall go myself and receive him with respect. 
train_hindifullfemale_03358| If the king is satisfied he can give only money. 
train_hindifullfemale_03359| But the master honours his servant, the servant is ready to sacrifice his life, for the sake of the master. 
train_hindifullfemale_03360| Therefore, it is wise that I should visit and appease him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03361| When Vishnu arrived to meet him, vulture felt guilty that he had said harsh words about the lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_03362| He said, Lord, the Sea who enjoys your protection has stolen the eggs of my servants and thus insulted me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03363| Because of respect for you, I delayed taking action against him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03364| True, learned men say that a master is responsible for the misdeeds of his servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03365| Such misdeeds hurt the master more than the servant. Come with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03366| I shall recover those eggs from the Sea and make the pheasant pair happy again. 
train_hindifullfemale_03367| Later we will go to Amaravathi, said Lord Vishnu. 
train_hindifullfemale_03368| The Lord then took out his thunderbolt and aiming it at the Sea warned him, You wicked man, return the eggs to the bird pair. 
train_hindifullfemale_03369| Otherwise, I will turn the sea into a desert. 
train_hindifullfemale_03370| Frightened, the Sea returned the eggs to the pheasants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03371| The male bird handed them to his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_03372| From this story, Sham told Bullock, it is evident that he who challenges an enemy without knowing his strength perishes in the end. 
train_hindifullfemale_03373| True, but how do I know that Lion has evil designs against me? We have been very friendly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03374| That makes it difficult for me think of killing him, said Bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_03375| Sham said, He stares at you in anger if he has evil thoughts in his mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03376| Otherwise, you may safely think he is the same old affectionate friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03377| But if you decide to leave the place do it after sunset. 
train_hindifullfemale_03378| Our elders have said that one must sacrifice an individual for the good of the community. 
train_hindifullfemale_03379| Give up caste for the good of the village and surrender a village for the good of the country. 
train_hindifullfemale_03380| It is desirable to save money so that one can spend it in a crisis, spend money to save his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_03381| And give up both his wealth and wife to save himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_03382| After he gave this advice to Bullock, Sham went to see Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_03383| Hailing him, Ram said, What happened to your mission? 
train_hindifullfemale_03384| I have just finished sowing the seeds of discord among the two friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03385| The rest is in the hands of God, said Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03386| Let me know how you did it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03387| I have carried tales from one to the other and succeeded in dividing the friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03388| You will not see them again together. 
train_hindifullfemale_03389| You have not done anything good. 
train_hindifullfemale_03390| You have separated two good friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03391| You have made them hate each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_03392| A wicked person knows only to harm but not mend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03393| You do not know political science. 
train_hindifullfemale_03394| However strong you are, unless you kill the enemy or the disease at the very outset, your enemy or the disease will kill you in the end. 
train_hindifullfemale_03395| Bullock stole the minister ship from us and so he is our enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03396| I won the king's assurance for him and brought him to the court of the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03397| Today, he has ousted us from our office. 
train_hindifullfemale_03398| That is why I have plans to kill him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03399| If he wants to save himself, he should leave this place. 
train_hindifullfemale_03400| Wise men, do not hesitate to torment others to achieve their goal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03401| Fools like the lion cannot enjoy even what they have won. 
train_hindifullfemale_03402| On Ram's request, Sham began telling that story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03403| Sham continued, That is why I told you that a wise man protects his interest even if it is to torment others 
train_hindifullfemale_03404| And never shares his secrets with others, as the jackal did in the above story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03405| Bullock began pondering, Why did I do this. 
train_hindifullfemale_03406| A vegetarian serving a meat eater! 
train_hindifullfemale_03407| What shall I do and where shall I go? 
train_hindifullfemale_03408| Perhaps, Lion may spare me because he had given me assurance. 
train_hindifullfemale_03409| Trouble may sometimes come to people who walk the path of ethical conduct. 
train_hindifullfemale_03410| Every living being does good and sometimes bad deeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_03411| He will reap the consequences in the next birth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03412| So, we cannot escape what fate has in store for us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03413| With these thoughts on his mind Bullock went to see the lion, and sat down without greeting him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03414| The lion also was surprised at the bullock's arrogance and, believing what Sham had told him about Bullock, pounced on him tearing him with his claws. 
train_hindifullfemale_03415| Bullock too began goring the lion with his horns. 
train_hindifullfemale_03416| Seeing that the jackal and the lion were determined to fight to the end, Ram admonished Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03417| You fool! You have created a rift between the two friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03418| If the lord dies, how can you be a minister? 
train_hindifullfemale_03419| How do you aspire to be a minister when you do not know the principles of diplomacy? 
train_hindifullfemale_03420| War mongers like you can never reach their goals. 
train_hindifullfemale_03421| You should not use force where there is still room for peace. 
train_hindifullfemale_03422| One of the two is bound to die. 
train_hindifullfemale_03423| Save the situation if you can, No, it is my folly to tell you what is good and what is bad. 
train_hindifullfemale_03424| Elders have said that one should not preach to one who is not a disciple. 
train_hindifullfemale_03425| As Ram and Sham were discussing the ways of the world, Bullock engaged Lion in a short battle. 
train_hindifullfemale_03426| In the battle Lion clawed bullock to death. 
train_hindifullfemale_03427| But the lion was immediately struck by remorse and, recalling the good days he had spent with the bullock, began repenting. 
train_hindifullfemale_03428| I have committed a great sin by killing my friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03429| There cannot be a greater sin than killing a trusted friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03430| They who forget a favour or breach a trust or let down a friend will all go to hell as long as the sun and the moon shine in the sky. 
train_hindifullfemale_03431| A king will perish whether what he loses is his kingdom or a faithful servant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03432| A servant and a kingdom are not the same because you can always win back the kingdom but not a trusted servant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03433| In the court, I have always praised Lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03434| How can I explain his death to the courtiers? Sham approached the grief stricken king and told him, lord, ruing the death of a grass eater is cowardice. 
train_hindifullfemale_03435| It is not good for a king like you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03436| The learned have always said that it is not a sin to kill a person for the reason even if that person is a father, brother, son, wife or a friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03437| Sham continued, You are mourning the death of someone who does not deserve sympathy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03438| Though you are talking like a learned man, you forget that learned men do not think of the past or the dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_03439| These words of Sham worked like a tonic providing relief to Lion's troubled mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03440| Pleased with this advice, the lion king reappointed Sham as his minister and continued to rule the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03441| Then the two foxes sat on discussing many worldly wise stories. 
train_hindifullfemale_03442| Ram blamed shyam for his action and said You have the example of the bird muktha. 
train_hindifullfemale_03443| I am eager to know what it is, said Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03444| The story of muktha and The monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_03445| A gang of monkeys made their home in a mountain slope. 
train_hindifullfemale_03446| When winter came, it brought not only severe cold but also heavy rains. 
train_hindifullfemale_03447| Unable to stand the cold, the monkey collected red berries wildly growing in the mountain slope. 
train_hindifullfemale_03448| They gathered around the berries and began blowing air at them thinking they were embers. 
train_hindifullfemale_03449| Watching their vain effort in amusement, muktha, a bird, told them, You fools, they are not embers but red berries. 
train_hindifullfemale_03450| Why do you waste your energy on them? This will not save you from cold. 
train_hindifullfemale_03451| Go and look for a shelter in a cave or a place free from wind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03452| The clouds are thick and there will be no immediate relief from rain. 
train_hindifullfemale_03453| An old member of the monkey gang angrily told the bird, Why do you poke your nose in our affairs? Go away. 
train_hindifullfemale_03454| Haven't the elders said that he who cherishes his welfare should not talk to a gambler or an inefficient workman. 
train_hindifullfemale_03455| So is the person a fool who talks to an idiot or a pleasure seeker. 
train_hindifullfemale_03456| Disregarding the old monkey's anger and not giving room to any other monkey to talk. 
train_hindifullfemale_03457| Muktha went on repeating his advice to them to seek shelter elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_03458| Tired with the bird's unwanted advice, one of the monkey sprang at the bird and bashed him against a rock till he was dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_03459| Ram said at the end of the story, If you counsel a fool it will only provoke him and not pacify. 
train_hindifullfemale_03460| If you feed milk to a snake it will increase its store of poison. 
train_hindifullfemale_03461| That's why you should not offer advice to everyone. 
train_hindifullfemale_03462| Look, how two good sparrows lost their home, all due to a foolish monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_03463| At Sham's request, Ram began telling the story of the evil monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_03464| Fools ignore advice and wise men follow it and benefit by it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03465| It is clear that you haven't heard the story of dharma and his Son, the story of how the father was killed by smoke due to the son's thoughtlessness. 
train_hindifullfemale_03466| Why do you not tell me that story, asked Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03467| In a city in the north, lived two friends named dharma and Karan. 
train_hindifullfemale_03468| One day, Karan thought, I am a man without worldly wisdom and added to that I am also poor. 
train_hindifullfemale_03469| Let me persuade Dharma to take me to far off lands and earn lots of money through his business skills. 
train_hindifullfemale_03470| Later I will deprive him of all his wealth and live happily ever after. 
train_hindifullfemale_03471| With these plans in his mind, Karan told Dharma, My friend, you are growing old and cannot manage your business. 
train_hindifullfemale_03472| Unless you go out into the wide world how can you tell your children about the wonders of the world? 
train_hindifullfemale_03473| Elders have said that he is born in vain who does not see the countries in the world, learn several languages and know the dress styles of other people. 
train_hindifullfemale_03474| You cannot earn wealth and knowledge without wide travel. 
train_hindifullfemale_03475| Dharma liked this advice and taking the blessings of his teachers set out on overseas travel, taking Karan with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03476| Both of them earned a lot of money abroad due to the business talent of Dharma. 
train_hindifullfemale_03477| It was time for them to return home because it is natural for people who go abroad in search of wealth and learning to think of home when they have achieved both. 
train_hindifullfemale_03478| As they were entering their native place, Karan told Dharma, It is not safe to take home all this wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03479| Because relatives and friends in need will seek help if they know about our riches. 
train_hindifullfemale_03480| We shall bury most of our money in some secret place in this forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03481| Whenever we need money, we can come here and take whatever we need. 
train_hindifullfemale_03482| You know that money tempts even saints. 
train_hindifullfemale_03483| Dharma agreed to Karan's plan and went home after both of them dug a pit and covered it after burying most of their earnings in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03484| One midnight Karan went to the secret place in the forest and stole all the money and brought it home. 
train_hindifullfemale_03485| Next morning, he went to Dharma and suggested that they should go to the forest because he was in need of money. 
train_hindifullfemale_03486| When both of them arrived at the secret spot in the forest and dug there, they found the pit empty. 
train_hindifullfemale_03487| At once Karan began shouting loudly, Dharma, you stole the money and nobody else. 
train_hindifullfemale_03488| The pit was carefully covered. 
train_hindifullfemale_03489| You must give me half of what we have buried here. 
train_hindifullfemale_03490| Though Dharma denied it, Karan insisted that they should take the dispute to a court of law. 
train_hindifullfemale_03491| When the case came before the court, the judge asked them to take oath in the name of God. 
train_hindifullfemale_03492| But Karan quoted experts as saying that relevant documents should be produced first as proof. 
train_hindifullfemale_03493| Then let the witnesses would be summoned to give evidence and oath in the name of God is taken when neither documents nor witnesses are available. 
train_hindifullfemale_03494| I can produce the gods of the forest as witnesses. 
train_hindifullfemale_03495| They will determine who is guilty and who is innocent, said Karan. 
train_hindifullfemale_03496| Impressed by this plan, the judges asked both the parties to be present next morning at the forest for a hearing. 
train_hindifullfemale_03497| Happy at the judges' order, Karan went home and told his father, Father, I have stolen all Dharma's money. 
train_hindifullfemale_03498| There is a case in the court that I can win only with your help. 
train_hindifullfemale_03499| Otherwise, my life will be in danger. 
train_hindifullfemale_03500| What have I to do to get that money, son, asked his father. 
train_hindifullfemale_03501| There is a big tree there. 
train_hindifullfemale_03502| You have to go now and hide in the hollow of that tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03503| Tomorrow morning when the judges and others assemble there, I will ask you to tell the truth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03504| Then it is your turn to declare that Dharma is the thief, said the son. 
train_hindifullfemale_03505| The father left at once for the forest to hide in the hollow of the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03506| The morning of the next day, the son took a bath and went to the tree taking Dharma and the judges with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03507| Karan went near the tree and shouted, sun, moon, air, fire, earth, water, the God of Death, day and night, you are all witnesses to the history of humanity. 
train_hindifullfemale_03508| Goddess of the Forest, declare who among us is guilty. 
train_hindifullfemale_03509| The father shouted back from inside the hollow of the tree, Listen all of you, it is Dharma who stole the money. 
train_hindifullfemale_03510| The judges and the king's men heard the verdict and sat down to decide what punishment they should give Dharma. 
train_hindifullfemale_03511| Meanwhile, Dharma filled the hollow with rags and hay, poured oil on them and threw a matchstick into it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03512| The fire forced the half burnt father to come out of the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03513| All this is the work of Karan's evil mind, said the father and soon collapsed and died. 
train_hindifullfemale_03514| The king's men at once bound Karan hand and foot and hung him to a tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03515| They said, Our elders have always said that wise men should not only be resourceful but also know the consequences of being resourceful. 
train_hindifullfemale_03516| You have the story of how a mongoose killed all the offspring of the crane before his own eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_03517| When Dharma asked them to tell the story, the king's men began relating the story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03518| The story of a foolish crane and a mongoose. 
train_hindifullfemale_03519| A big banyan tree was home to a number of cranes in a forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03520| In the hollow of that tree lived a cobra, which used to feed on the young cranes which did not yet learn to fly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03521| When the mother crane saw the cobra killing her offspring, she began crying. 
train_hindifullfemale_03522| Seeing the sorrowing crane, a crab asked her what made her cry. 
train_hindifullfemale_03523| The crane told the crab, Every day, the cobra living in this tree is killing my children. 
train_hindifullfemale_03524| I am not able to contain my grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_03525| Please show me some way to get rid of this cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_03526| The crab then thought, These cranes are our born enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_03527| I shall give her advice that is misleading and suicidal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03528| That will see the end of all these cranes. 
train_hindifullfemale_03529| Elders have always said that if you want to wipe out your enemy your words should be soft like butter and your heart like a stone. 
train_hindifullfemale_03530| Then the crab told the crane, Uncle, strew pieces of meat from the mongoose's burrow to the hollow of the cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_03531| The mongoose will follow the trail of meat to the cobra burrow and will kill it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03532| The crane did as the crab advised her. 
train_hindifullfemale_03533| The mongoose came following the meat trail and killed not only the cobra but also all the cranes on the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03534| That is why, the king's men said, if you have a strategy, you must also know what the strategy would lead to. 
train_hindifullfemale_03535| Karan considered only the crooked plan but not what would follow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03536| He reaped the consequences. 
train_hindifullfemale_03537| Ram told Sham, That's why like Karan you haven't foreseen what will happen if you went ahead with your plans. 
train_hindifullfemale_03538| You have an evil mind, I knew it from your plans to endanger the life of our lord. 
train_hindifullfemale_03539| Your place is not with us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03540| If a rat had a thousand pound scale for its lunch, is it any wonder that a kite carried away a child? 
train_hindifullfemale_03541| What about it, asked Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03542| Ram told him the following story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03543| Raman was the son of a rich merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03544| But he had lost all his wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03545| He thought he should go abroad. 
train_hindifullfemale_03546| He told himself that he who had once prospered should not live in the same place as a poor man. 
train_hindifullfemale_03547| People who respected him once would now look down upon him and shun him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03548| Deciding to go abroad to seek his fortune, he mortgaged with a local merchant the thousand pound balance his ancestors had left behind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03549| He went abroad with the money the merchant gave him and after several years came home and asked the merchant to return him the balance. 
train_hindifullfemale_03550| The merchant said, where is the balance? The rats have gnawed at it for food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03551| Raman replied without emotion, I cannot blame you for what the rats have done. 
train_hindifullfemale_03552| The world is like that. Nothing really is permanent. 
train_hindifullfemale_03553| Any way, I am going to the river to take the purification bath. 
train_hindifullfemale_03554| Please send with me your son Deva to look after my needs. 
train_hindifullfemale_03555| Afraid that Raman would accuse him of theft, the merchant called his son and told him, Son, your uncle is going to the river for a bath. 
train_hindifullfemale_03556| You accompany him taking with you all the things he needs to take his bath. 
train_hindifullfemale_03557| Men offer help not only out of kindness but also out of fear, greed etc. 
train_hindifullfemale_03558| If one offers help for reasons other than this, you have to be wary of such a person. 
train_hindifullfemale_03559| The merchant's son followed Raman to the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_03560| After taking bath, he led the boy into a nearby cave and, pushing the boy inside, closed it with a huge boulder. 
train_hindifullfemale_03561| When Raman returned from the river, the merchant asked him, honoured guest, didn't you bring back my son? 
train_hindifullfemale_03562| Where is he? Please tell me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03563| Raman told him, A kite has carried away your boy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03564| There was nothing I could do. 
train_hindifullfemale_03565| You cheat, is this possible? 
train_hindifullfemale_03566| How can a kite carry away a boy? Bring my boy back. 
train_hindifullfemale_03567| Otherwise, I will go to the king and complain. 
train_hindifullfemale_03568| Yes, just as a kite cannot carry away a boy, rats also cannot eat away heavy iron balance. 
train_hindifullfemale_03569| If you want your boy, give me back my balance, said Raman. 
train_hindifullfemale_03570| Both of them took the dispute to the king's court. 
train_hindifullfemale_03571| The merchant complained to the judges that Raman had kidnapped his child. 
train_hindifullfemale_03572| The judges ordered him to return the boy to the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03573| Raman told the judges the entire story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03574| There upon, the judges ordered Raman to return the boy and the merchant to give back the balance to Raman. 
train_hindifullfemale_03575| Ram then told Sham, You have done this foul deed because you were jealous of the king's friendship with Bullock. 
train_hindifullfemale_03576| It is not without reason that our elders have said,. 
train_hindifullfemale_03577| Fools hate the learned. 
train_hindifullfemale_03578| The poor blame the rich. 
train_hindifullfemale_03579| The miser riles the giver. 
train_hindifullfemale_03580| The wicked abhor the virtuous. 
train_hindifullfemale_03581| You have tried to help us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03582| But you have hurt us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03583| It is like the well meaning monkey killing the king, said Ram. 
train_hindifullfemale_03584| What did the monkey do? asked Sham. 
train_hindifullfemale_03585| Once upon a time, there was a king who kept a monkey as a pet. 
train_hindifullfemale_03586| The monkey served the king in whatever way he could. 
train_hindifullfemale_03587| He had a free run of the royal household because he was the king's pet. 
train_hindifullfemale_03588| One hot day the monkey sat fanning by the side of the king who was sleeping. 
train_hindifullfemale_03589| He noticed a fly on the chest of the king and tried to swish it away. 
train_hindifullfemale_03590| The fly would go away for the moment and come back again to sit on the king's chest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03591| The monkey could take it no longer and decided to teach the fly a lesson. 
train_hindifullfemale_03592| He looked for a dagger to kill it and when he found it brought it down with all force on the fly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03593| The fly flew away but the king died as result of the dagger blow delivered by the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_03594| Ram said, Therefore, the lesson is that a king who cares for his life should not have a fool as his servant. 
train_hindifullfemale_03595| He went on to relate a second story to show how shrewd people save the lives of others. 
train_hindifullfemale_03596| Once upon a time a man lived in a big city and as a result of his misdeeds in his previous birth he became a thief. 
train_hindifullfemale_03597| He saw four merchants from another city selling a variety of goods in his city. 
train_hindifullfemale_03598| He thought he should somehow deprive the four merchants of their money and through sweet words become their good friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03599| He was useful to them in whatever way he could. 
train_hindifullfemale_03600| True, it comes naturally for women of vice to act coy and for charlatans to pretend to be learned. 
train_hindifullfemale_03601| The four visitors sold all their goods and with the money from the sales bought pearls and precious jewels. 
train_hindifullfemale_03602| The thief was keeping an eye on what they were doing even as he pretended to serve them faithfully. 
train_hindifullfemale_03603| One day, in the presence of the thief, the traders cut open their thighs and storing the jewels and pearls inside the thighs sewed them back. 
train_hindifullfemale_03604| The thief was disappointed that they did not give him even a small part of their wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03605| He immediately decided to follow them and kill them in the middle of their journey back home and take all that wealth from them. 
train_hindifullfemale_03606| He told the traders with tears in his eyes, Friends, you seem to be ready to leave me behind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03607| My heart is broken because it is difficult for me to snap the bonds of friendship with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03608| If you will be so kind as to take me with you, I will be very grateful to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03609| Moved by his request, the traders started their homeward journey accompanied by the Brahmin thief. 
train_hindifullfemale_03610| They passed through several villages, towns and cities before they reached a village inhabited by thugs. 
train_hindifullfemale_03611| Suddenly, they heard a group of crows loudly shouting, You thugs, very rich people are coming. 
train_hindifullfemale_03612| Come, kill them and become rich. 
train_hindifullfemale_03613| The thugs at once attacked the traders with sticks and began examining their bags. 
train_hindifullfemale_03614| But they found nothing. 
train_hindifullfemale_03615| They were surprised because this was the first time that the words of the crows turned out to be false. 
train_hindifullfemale_03616| They told the traders, traders, the crows always tell the truth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03617| You have the money with you somewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_03618| Take it out or we will cut every limb of yours and bring it out. 
train_hindifullfemale_03619| The thief pondered, These thugs will certainly pierce the body of the traders to grab the jewels. 
train_hindifullfemale_03620| My turn also will come. 
train_hindifullfemale_03621| It is better I offer myself to these thugs and save the lives of the Merchants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03622| There is no point in fearing death because it will come today or after hundred years, One cannot escape it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03623| With these thoughts on his mind, the thief asked the thugs to first kill him and see if there was anything valuable on his body. 
train_hindifullfemale_03624| The thugs accepted the offer and found nothing on him after they pierced his body. 
train_hindifullfemale_03625| They let go the other four merchants thinking that they also did not have anything precious on their bodies. 
train_hindifullfemale_03626| Gaining Friends, This is the second strategy of Panchatantra known as Gaining Friends beginning with this stanza. 
train_hindifullfemale_03627| Even without the wherewithal, Learned men and intellectuals. 
train_hindifullfemale_03628| Achieve what they want like, the crow, the rat, the deer and the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_03629| There was a city in the south not far off from where was a large banyan tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03630| Many species of birds came there to eat the tree's fruit. 
train_hindifullfemale_03631| In the hollow of the great tree lived poisonous reptiles like snakes and scorpions. 
train_hindifullfemale_03632| Travellers found the tree a great shelter in their journeys. 
train_hindifullfemale_03633| A crow made this tree his home. 
train_hindifullfemale_03634| As he was flying one day towards the city for collecting food, he sighted a hunter carrying a net and approaching the tree like a messenger of death. 
train_hindifullfemale_03635| The crow at once sensed danger. 
train_hindifullfemale_03636| The crow is pretty sure that the hunter will come to trap the birds on the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_03637| He told all the birds, his Friends that the wicked hunter has seeds in his bag that he will scatter to lure you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03638| Do not trust him and avoid the seeds like poison. 
train_hindifullfemale_03639| The hunter came, sowed the seeds and spread the net. 
train_hindifullfemale_03640| He left the spot and sat elsewhere not to arouse the suspicion of the birds. 
train_hindifullfemale_03641| Warned by crow, the birds stayed away from the seeds as though they were poisonous berries. 
train_hindifullfemale_03642| Meanwhile, king of doves, saw the seeds from a distance and landed there with his retinue of one thousand doves. 
train_hindifullfemale_03643| They came to eat the seeds ignoring the warnings of crow and soon the hunter spread his net and trapped all of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_03644| That is why elders have said that fools can never foresee peril. 
train_hindifullfemale_03645| People often lose sense when danger lurks in the corner. 
train_hindifullfemale_03646| Dove King and his retinue, however, kept their cool in the face of danger. 
train_hindifullfemale_03647| He appealed to his friends not to panic. 
train_hindifullfemale_03648| Elders have said that they tide over danger, who are not scared by crisis. 
train_hindifullfemale_03649| Let us fly together and land elsewhere where the hunter cannot reach us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03650| We can then plan a strategy to get out of this net. 
train_hindifullfemale_03651| If we do not fly now, we are all doomed, said Dove King. 
train_hindifullfemale_03652| Thereupon, all of them flew together. 
train_hindifullfemale_03653| The hunter followed the flight of the doves and looking upwards chanted, They are flying together. 
train_hindifullfemale_03654| But the moment there is a break in their unity they will crash to the ground. 
train_hindifullfemale_03655| The crow, also followed the flying doves to see what they would do. 
train_hindifullfemale_03656| When he lost sight of the birds, the hunter gave up and went home ruing that he had lost his net also. 
train_hindifullfemale_03657| When he was sure that the hunter had failed to chase them, the king of the doves told his friends, 
train_hindifullfemale_03658| The hunter has disappeared. 
train_hindifullfemale_03659| Let us all now fly towards the city where I have a friend, who is a rat. 
train_hindifullfemale_03660| He is our only hope, It is only a friend who will come to the aid of those in trouble. 
train_hindifullfemale_03661| The birds, heeding the advice of the king, flew to the fort of rat in the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_03662| Standing outside the fort, Dove King shouted, friend, come quickly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03663| We are in great trouble. Without coming out, rat shouted back,Who are you sir and what do you want from me? 
train_hindifullfemale_03664| What is the kind of trouble that is bothering you? Let me know. 
train_hindifullfemale_03665| I am your friend king of the doves, Come out soon. 
train_hindifullfemale_03666| Rat came out and was happy to see Dove King with his retinue and asked what was the matter. 
train_hindifullfemale_03667| The king of the doves said, Whatever man does for whatever reasons, in whatever manner and wherever in his last birth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03668| He reaps the consequences for the same reasons, in the same manner and in the same place. 
train_hindifullfemale_03669| All of us are trapped in this net because of our weakness for food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03670| Come at once and free us from this trap, urged Dove King. 
train_hindifullfemale_03671| Rat said, It is rightly said that a bird can recognise food from fifty miles but cannot see the danger lurking next to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03672| After delivering this sermon, the rat set out to free Dove King first. 
train_hindifullfemale_03673| But the king of doves pleaded with him to first liberate his friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03674| The rat was angry and reminded Dove King that it was fair that the king became free first and then the servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_03675| No, it is not like that, countered Dove King. 
train_hindifullfemale_03676| They are all dedicated to my service and have left their families behind to come with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03677| I have to repay that debt, he said. 
train_hindifullfemale_03678| Pleased with his friend's love for his servants, rat said, Friend, I know the duties of a king. 
train_hindifullfemale_03679| I was only testing you, I will free everyone now. 
train_hindifullfemale_03680| This will win more doves for your retinue. 
train_hindifullfemale_03681| With the help of his other friends, the rat then bit off the entire net and all the doves came out. 
train_hindifullfemale_03682| Rat saw off Dove King and retinue and went back into his fort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03683| Seeing the whole drama of rat liberating Dove King and his friends, the crow, thought, I do not trust anyone. 
train_hindifullfemale_03684| On top of it, I have a fickle mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03685| I will seek his friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_03686| Our ancestors have always said that even if a wise man has everything he needs, he should still seek friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03687| Even if all the rivers flow into the Sea, the Sea still waits for the Moon to come out. 
train_hindifullfemale_03688| The story of a crow and rat discourse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03689| After he saw how rat had helped Dove King,the crow came down from his tree perch and called out the rat in a voice resembling that of Dove King. 
train_hindifullfemale_03690| The rat thought, What happened? Did I forget to free any bird? 
train_hindifullfemale_03691| The dove king must be calling me for the same purpose. 
train_hindifullfemale_03692| Not sure who was calling him, the rat shouted from inside his fort, Who are you? 
train_hindifullfemale_03693| The crow said who he was. 
train_hindifullfemale_03694| The rat further retreated into his fort and said, Go away at once, I do not know who you are. 
train_hindifullfemale_03695| I have come on an important business. Why do you not want to meet me? 
train_hindifullfemale_03696| The rat asked What do I gain by meeting you? 
train_hindifullfemale_03697| Sir, I have seen you liberating Dove King and his retinue. 
train_hindifullfemale_03698| I thought friendship with you would be useful in such a crisis. 
train_hindifullfemale_03699| I am seeking your hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_03700| Very odd! You are the diner and I am the dinner. 
train_hindifullfemale_03701| How can there be amity between the two? 
train_hindifullfemale_03702| Where there is enemity, there cannot be friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_03703| Didn't you hear the elders say, Friendship or marriage is always between equals in nature. 
train_hindifullfemale_03704| There cannot be any sort of bond between the weak and the strong. 
train_hindifullfemale_03705| He who seeks friendship with someone who is not an equal will earn ridicule. So, please go. 
train_hindifullfemale_03706| The crow replied, rat, I am waiting here at your doorstep. 
train_hindifullfemale_03707| If you reject my hand, I will starve here to death. 
train_hindifullfemale_03708| But friendship with you is not possible. 
train_hindifullfemale_03709| However hot the water, it still kills the fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_03710| We haven't even seen each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_03711| How can there be enemity between both of us? 
train_hindifullfemale_03712| Rat then explained, Enmity is of two kinds. 
train_hindifullfemale_03713| The first is natural and the second is artificial. 
train_hindifullfemale_03714| The second kind disappears when what caused it disappears. 
train_hindifullfemale_03715| But natural enmity ends only with the death of one of the two enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_03716| Can you make it clearer, asked crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03717| Yes, artificial enmity is always based on some reason. 
train_hindifullfemale_03718| Natural enmity is like the one between a snake and a mongoose, water and fire, dogs and cats, the rich and the poor, the learned and the illiterate, between women of virtue and vice. 
train_hindifullfemale_03719| The crow then pleaded, Sir, what you say is unreasonable. 
train_hindifullfemale_03720| There is always a reason behind friendship and enmity. 
train_hindifullfemale_03721| That is why a wise man should always seek friendship and not enmity. 
train_hindifullfemale_03722| True, it is foolish to think that you will not come to harm because you are a man of character. 
train_hindifullfemale_03723| People who are blinded by ignorance and anger do not consider your character, said the rat. 
train_hindifullfemale_03724| Friendship with bad men is like a pot of clay easy to break but difficult to rejoin. 
train_hindifullfemale_03725| With good men it is like pot of gold, difficult to break but easy to mend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03726| I pledge that you will have no reason to fear danger from me, said the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03727| Rat said, I have no faith in pledges. 
train_hindifullfemale_03728| Do not trust an enemy with whom you have made peace. 
train_hindifullfemale_03729| Even if the hole is small, water seeping through it can sink a ship. 
train_hindifullfemale_03730| Do not trust a person untrustworthy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03731| Faith has its own limits, The evil that trust brings, leaves you totally destroyed. 
train_hindifullfemale_03732| Him who is highly skeptical. 
train_hindifullfemale_03733| The mighty cannot put an end to. 
train_hindifullfemale_03734| Him who trusts others easily. 
train_hindifullfemale_03735| Even the weakest can kill. 
train_hindifullfemale_03736| After this long sermon, crow didn't know how to reply. 
train_hindifullfemale_03737| Rat, he thought, was a very knowledgeable being and that was a strong reason for him to seek his friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_03738| Turning to the rat, he said, Seven words are enough to bring two good people together. 
train_hindifullfemale_03739| We have already talked a lot, which makes us good friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03740| That's why please believe what I say. 
train_hindifullfemale_03741| If it is not possible, I will stay out and you can talk to me from within your stronghold. 
train_hindifullfemale_03742| Impressed by his sincerity, rat said, Okay, you should not step inside my fort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03743| When crow agreed to that condition, the two became friends and enjoyed their daily meetings and long talks. 
train_hindifullfemale_03744| They helped each other, the crow bringing pieces of meat and relics of offerings to God at temples for the rat. 
train_hindifullfemale_03745| The rat in turn bringing for rat grains of paddy and food items. 
train_hindifullfemale_03746| Thus they became great and inseparable friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_03747| The scene of meeting a new friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_03748| One day, the crow came calling on the mouse with eyes full of tears. 
train_hindifullfemale_03749| Worried, the mouse asked, What's the matter? Why are you so sad? 
train_hindifullfemale_03750| I am thoroughly fed up with this country. 
train_hindifullfemale_03751| I want to go elsewhere, replied the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03752| But what is the reason for this sudden change of mind, asked the mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03753| There is a famine here. 
train_hindifullfemale_03754| People are dying like locusts. 
train_hindifullfemale_03755| No one is offering cooked rice for the peace of the dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_03756| So, I do not have food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03757| Hunters are busy trapping birds in their nets. 
train_hindifullfemale_03758| I have escaped narrowly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03759| I do not know when my turn will come. 
train_hindifullfemale_03760| I want to leave this country before it comes, said the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03761| What are your travel plans then, asked the mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03762| But how can you come with me, asked the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03763| I am a bird and can fly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03764| You cannot do that, said the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03765| That is no problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_03766| I will sit on your back and we can fly off, suggested the mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03767| That's an idea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03768| I will be doubly happy there because I have the company of the turtle and also yours. 
train_hindifullfemale_03769| Come, get on my back. 
train_hindifullfemale_03770| We will fly together, said the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03771| On a fine day, the crow with the mouse on his back flew to the great lake in the middle of the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_03772| Crow's friend the turtle, saw him with the mouse on his back and thought, This crow is not an ordinary crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03773| It is better I hide from him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03774| The turtle immediately ducked under water. 
train_hindifullfemale_03775| But the crow saw the turtle going down and understood that his friend did not recognise him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03776| The crow then left the mouse at the bottom of a tree and flying to the top of it loudly addressed the turtle,turtle, I am your friend crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03777| Come out and welcome me who has come to see an old friend after a long time. 
train_hindifullfemale_03778| Recognising his friend's voice, turtle came out of the water and with tears of joy in his eyes, said, crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03779| I am so happy you have come, Come and hug me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03780| We are meeting after a long time and that's why I could not immediately recognise you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03781| You know the saying that you should not make friends with him whose power and pedigree are not known to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03782| The crow then came down from the tree and the two of them embraced each other in joy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03783| They began telling each other about what happened in the long interval of their separation. 
train_hindifullfemale_03784| The mouse too came out of the hole, he was hiding in, greeted the turtle, and sat by the crow's side. 
train_hindifullfemale_03785| The turtle asked the crow, who is this little friend of yours? 
train_hindifullfemale_03786| Why did you bring him here on your back though he is your food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03787| He is my friend rat, I can't live without him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03788| Just as you can't count the stars in the sky and the sands on the seashore, I can't recount his great qualities. 
train_hindifullfemale_03789| He is fed up with this world, That is why he has followed me on my visit to you, said the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03790| But there should be some reason for his despair, said the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_03791| The crow replied, I have asked him to tell me the reasons. 
train_hindifullfemale_03792| He said he would tell us after meeting you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03793| Turning to the mouse, the crow asked him, Now it is your turn to tell us why you are so fed up with the world. 
train_hindifullfemale_03794| Rat began telling his story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03795| The Hermit and The Mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03796| In the south of this city, said rat, lived a hermit in a Shiva temple on the outskirts of the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_03797| Every day, he would go out into the city, collect alms and cook his food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03798| After the meal, he would store whatever is left in his begging bowl and hang it to a peg and go to sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_03799| He would give the leftovers to poor people in return for services rendered to the temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_03800| They would every day wash it, clean it and decorate it with patterns of chalk. 
train_hindifullfemale_03801| One day, some of my relatives complained to me, that the hermit is storing the food in his bowl and hanging it high to a peg. 
train_hindifullfemale_03802| We are not able to nibble at it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03803| You alone can reach any place. 
train_hindifullfemale_03804| Why should we go anywhere else when you are there? Let's go to the hermit's place and with your help feed ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_03805| Accompanied by my relatives, I went to the hermit's place and springing at the bowl brought the stored food down. 
train_hindifullfemale_03806| All of us then had a good meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03807| We repeated this act every day till the hermit found what we were doing. 
train_hindifullfemale_03808| He brought a split bamboo and began striking the food bowl with it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03809| That noise used to frighten us and we would spend the whole night waiting for a respite from this noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_03810| But the hermit never stopped striking the bamboo. 
train_hindifullfemale_03811| Meanwhile, a visitor named Veer came calling on the hermit. 
train_hindifullfemale_03812| Hermit received him with great respect and did whatever he could to make the honoured guest happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03813| At night, the guest would relate to the hermit tales about his travels. 
train_hindifullfemale_03814| But hermit, busy scaring the mice with his bamboo, would not pay much attention to what his guest was narrating. 
train_hindifullfemale_03815| In the middle of the story, the guest would ask him questions to which he would give indifferent replies. 
train_hindifullfemale_03816| Angry with hermit's absent mindedness, the visitor told him, hermit, you are not a great friend of mine because you are not attentive to what I am telling you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03817| I will leave your place tonight and seek shelter elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_03818| The elders have always said that you must not accept the hospitality of such a host who does not welcome you gladly. 
train_hindifullfemale_03819| You did not offer you a proper seat and does not make inquiries about your well being. 
train_hindifullfemale_03820| Status has gone to your head. 
train_hindifullfemale_03821| You do not any more care for my friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_03822| You do not know that this conduct will take you to hell. 
train_hindifullfemale_03823| I am really sorry for what has happened to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03824| You have become vain and proud. 
train_hindifullfemale_03825| I am leaving this temple at once, Veer said. 
train_hindifullfemale_03826| Frightened at his visitor's words, hermit pleaded with him, O worshipful guest, please do not be harsh on me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03827| I do not have any friends other than you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03828| Here is the reason why I was not attentive to your discourse on religion. 
train_hindifullfemale_03829| There is this mouse, which every day steals my food however high I keep it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03830| As a result, I am not able to feed the poor people who do the job of keeping the temple clean. 
train_hindifullfemale_03831| The temple is now in a bad shape. To scare this culprit, I have to keep tapping the food bowl with the bamboo stick I keep with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03832| This is why I was not able to pay attention to the great and learned tales you have been relating. 
train_hindifullfemale_03833| Realising what really was the problem, the visitor asked the hermit, Do you know where the mouse lives? 
train_hindifullfemale_03834| Sir, I have no idea, said hermit. 
train_hindifullfemale_03835| The visitor said, This mouse must have stored a lot of food somewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_03836| It is this plenty that gives him the energy to jump so high and eat all your food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03837| When a man earns a lot of wealth, that pile of money increases his strength and confidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_03838| Veer continued, There is an explanation for everything in this world. 
train_hindifullfemale_03839| There is a reason for Shandili trying to exchange husked sesame seeds in return for degraded sesame seeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_03840| Hermit asked Veer to tell him who this Shandili was and the story of sesame seeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_03841| The story of shandili and sesame seeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_03842| Veer began telling the story. 
train_hindifullfemale_03843| I sought the hospitality of a Brahmin one day for sacred ceremonies connected with the monsoon season. 
train_hindifullfemale_03844| He was kind enough to offer me space in his house and in return I used to render services he found useful in his rituals. 
train_hindifullfemale_03845| As this arrangement continued, one fine morning I heard the Brahmin and his wife Shandili discussing what they should do for the day. 
train_hindifullfemale_03846| The husband told his wife, Today is the time when the Sun begins his northward journey and a time when the rich and pious people offer gifts to Brahmins. 
train_hindifullfemale_03847| I am going to the next village to receive the offerings. 
train_hindifullfemale_03848| You will do well to invite a Brahmin as guest today and offer him food in the name of the Sun. 
train_hindifullfemale_03849| The wife flew into a rage and told him, How can I offer anything to anyone in our poverty stricken house? 
train_hindifullfemale_03850| Aren't you ashamed to make such a suggestion? 
train_hindifullfemale_03851| I have wasted my entire life as your wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_03852| I haven't tasted a good meal so far even on a single day. 
train_hindifullfemale_03853| Nor do I have any jewellery. 
train_hindifullfemale_03854| Though taken aback, the Brahmin quickly recovered and said, Such words are not becoming of you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03855| The learned say that if you share even half of your meal with a mendicant, you will get whatever you wish in life. 
train_hindifullfemale_03856| What good the rich reap by liberally giving away, the poor get by parting with even a cent they have. 
train_hindifullfemale_03857| The giver deserves to be served even if he is poor. 
train_hindifullfemale_03858| But a rich miser is shunned. 
train_hindifullfemale_03859| It is like the well and the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03860| People drink the water from the well and not the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_03861| We must always give to him who deserves. 
train_hindifullfemale_03862| Greed can only destroy a person. 
train_hindifullfemale_03863| How is it? asked the wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_03864| The husband then told Shandili the story of the hunter and the greedy jackal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03865| A hunter went to the forest in search of a kill. 
train_hindifullfemale_03866| Spotting a well fed boar he took his bow and aimed a sharp arrow at the boar. 
train_hindifullfemale_03867| Though severely wounded, the boar made a wild charge at the hunter goring him to death. 
train_hindifullfemale_03868| The boar too died later from the wounds inflicted by the hunter. 
train_hindifullfemale_03869| Meanwhile, a hungry jackal, not knowing that he was doomed to die, came on the scene where the bodies of the hunter and the boar lay. 
train_hindifullfemale_03870| He was thrilled by the sight of so much food and thought, God has favoured me today. 
train_hindifullfemale_03871| That's why he has sent so much food for me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03872| It is not without reason that the learned have said that he who has done a good deed in a previous birth is rewarded in this birth even if he does not make any effort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03873| This great feast is certainly the result of some good I have done in a previous birth. 
train_hindifullfemale_03874| But a man must enjoy his wealth in small doses. 
train_hindifullfemale_03875| Therefore, I will begin my meal with this gut of the bow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03876| The jackal went close to the body of the hunter and began nibbling near the gut of the bow. 
train_hindifullfemale_03877| The gut suddenly snapped with great force killing the jackal in the end. 
train_hindifullfemale_03878| That's why, the Brahmin told his wife, Haven't you heard that a man's longevity, destiny, wealth, learning and death are predetermined by God even as the child is in the womb of the mother. 
train_hindifullfemale_03879| If that is the case, Shandili said, I have some unhusked sesame seeds in the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_03880| I will make a cake from it, and serve it to the Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_03881| Happy at his wife's words, the Brahmin left for the next village. 
train_hindifullfemale_03882| The wife soaked the seeds in warm water, removed their husk and left them on a cloth to dry in the sun. 
train_hindifullfemale_03883| As the Brahmin's wife was busy with other chores, a dog came and peed on the seeds left on the cloth to dry. 
train_hindifullfemale_03884| When the wife saw what the dog had done, she felt miserable that all her effort had gone in vain. 
train_hindifullfemale_03885| She thought that nobody could undo God's will. 
train_hindifullfemale_03886| She thought, These seeds cannot now be given away to anyone. 
train_hindifullfemale_03887| I will see if I can exchange them for un husked seeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_03888| Anybody will agree to this swap. 
train_hindifullfemale_03889| Veer continued his story, The Brahmin's wife came to the same house which I was visiting to accept offerings. 
train_hindifullfemale_03890| She offered to exchange the husked seeds to anyone ready to accept them. 
train_hindifullfemale_03891| Then the woman in the house came out and was ready to accept the husked seeds from the Brahmin's wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_03892| But her son intervened and told her, Mother, these seeds are not good. 
train_hindifullfemale_03893| Why should anyone give away good husked seeds for the raw seeds? There must be some reason for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03894| The housewife at once gave up the idea of taking husked seeds from the Brahmin's wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_03895| After Veer completed the story, he asked hermit, Do you know the route he rat takes to come here? I have no idea, said hermit. 
train_hindifullfemale_03896| Have you any tool to dig? asked the visitor. 
train_hindifullfemale_03897| Yes, I have a dibble with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03898| In that case, let us follow the mouse trail before it is erased, said the visitor. 
train_hindifullfemale_03899| Rat resumed his account and said, Listening to the conversation between hermit and Veer, I thought that my end had come. 
train_hindifullfemale_03900| Just as he had found my food store, he is capable of tracking my fort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03901| Learned men can measure the strength of the rival by just looking at him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03902| I decided immediately to take a new route and was on my way with the other mice when a fat cat sighted us. 
train_hindifullfemale_03903| He immediately pounced on us and killed a number of my retinue. 
train_hindifullfemale_03904| Excepting me, those of the bloodied mice who escaped being killed by the cat took the same old route to the fort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03905| The visitor saw the trail of blood the fleeing mice left behind and following it reached my fort. 
train_hindifullfemale_03906| There, Veer and hermit dug and found the food store. 
train_hindifullfemale_03907| The visitor told hermit, Here is the secret of the mouse's energy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03908| Now, you can sleep in peace. 
train_hindifullfemale_03909| Then they took the store to the temple, the home of hermit. 
train_hindifullfemale_03910| I went back to where I had stored food. 
train_hindifullfemale_03911| It was now like a desert. 
train_hindifullfemale_03912| Without food, the spot was a ghastly scene. 
train_hindifullfemale_03913| I did not know where to go and what to do to get back my peace of mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_03914| Somehow, I spent the day in sorrow and when it was dawn went to the temple followed by what remained of my retinue. 
train_hindifullfemale_03915| Alerted by the noise we made, hermit again began striking the food bowl with the bamboo. 
train_hindifullfemale_03916| Veer, the visitor, asked him why he was doing so. 
train_hindifullfemale_03917| Hermit told him, about our return. 
train_hindifullfemale_03918| The visitor laughed and told hermit, Friend, do not be afraid now. 
train_hindifullfemale_03919| The mouse has lost his energy. 
train_hindifullfemale_03920| I cannot do any mischief now. 
train_hindifullfemale_03921| When I heard this, I was angry and tried again to jump at the food bowl and crashed to the ground before I could reach the bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_03922| I was dejected by this failure. 
train_hindifullfemale_03923| But my sadness increased when I heard my retinue telling each other that I was no more capable of earning food for them and they should immediately give up serving me. 
train_hindifullfemale_03924| I then realised the importance of riches and decided to somehow steal it back from hermit. 
train_hindifullfemale_03925| When I made another attempt, the visitor saw me and banged the bamboo on my head. 
train_hindifullfemale_03926| I somehow managed to escape. 
train_hindifullfemale_03927| Elders have always said that man gets what he is destined to. 
train_hindifullfemale_03928| Even God cannot alter destiny. 
train_hindifullfemale_03929| So, I stopped brooding over what has happened because what is ours can never become others. 
train_hindifullfemale_03930| Explain that to us, asked crow and turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_03931| The Story of a merchant's son. 
train_hindifullfemale_03932| Sagar was a merchant living in one of the country's big cities. 
train_hindifullfemale_03933| He had a son, who, one day purchased a book whose only content was a single verse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03934| The verse read, Man gets what is in his destiny. 
train_hindifullfemale_03935| Even God cannot prevent it. 
train_hindifullfemale_03936| To me it makes no difference. 
train_hindifullfemale_03937| What's mine can never become others. 
train_hindifullfemale_03938| What is the price of this book, the father asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_03939| Hundred rupees, said the son. 
train_hindifullfemale_03940| The father flew into a rage and said, You are a fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_03941| You have paid hundred rupees for a book that has only one verse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03942| You can never come up in life. 
train_hindifullfemale_03943| Leave my house at once, It has no place for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_03944| Thrown out of the house, the boy went to another city and began fresh life there. 
train_hindifullfemale_03945| One day, a neighbour asked him, What is your native place and what is your name?. 
train_hindifullfemale_03946| The boy replied, Man gets what he is destined to. 
train_hindifullfemale_03947| He gave the same answer to whoever asked for his name. 
train_hindifullfemale_03948| From that day onwards, people began calling him Prapta, meaning the same line he was reciting to whomever asked his name. 
train_hindifullfemale_03949| The summer came and the city was celebrating it with a big fair. 
train_hindifullfemale_03950| One of the visitors to the fair was the city's princess and her maids. 
train_hindifullfemale_03951| The princess was young and beautiful. 
train_hindifullfemale_03952| As she was making the rounds of the fair, she saw an extremely handsome warrior and immediately fell in love with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03953| She told one of her maids, It is your job to see that both of us meet. 
train_hindifullfemale_03954| The maid ran to the warrior and told him, I have a message for you from our princess. 
train_hindifullfemale_03955| She says she will die if you do not meet her today. 
train_hindifullfemale_03956| But tell me where and how I can see her. 
train_hindifullfemale_03957| How can I enter the palace? asked the warrior. 
train_hindifullfemale_03958| The maid told him, Come to the palace and you will see a rope hanging from the high wall. 
train_hindifullfemale_03959| Climb and jump over the wall with the help of the rope. 
train_hindifullfemale_03960| All right, I will try to do it tonight, said the warrior. 
train_hindifullfemale_03961| When the night came, the warrior lost his nerve and thought, this is an improper thing to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_03962| The elders have said, He who has liaison with the daughter of a teacher, wife of a friend or of a master or of a servant commits the sin of killing the innocent. 
train_hindifullfemale_03963| Also, do not do what brings you a bad name or what denies you a place in heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_03964| In the end, the warrior decided not to meet the princess and stayed back at home. 
train_hindifullfemale_03965| Coming out for a walk in the night, Prapta noticed the rope outside the royal palace and curious to know what it is? 
train_hindifullfemale_03966| He went up the rope that took him inside the princess bedroom. 
train_hindifullfemale_03967| The princess mistook him for the warrior and served him dinner and with great ecstasy told Prapta, I have fallen in love with you at the very first sight. 
train_hindifullfemale_03968| I am yours, You are in my heart and nobody except you can be my husband. 
train_hindifullfemale_03969| Why do you not say something. 
train_hindifullfemale_03970| He replied, Man gets what he is destined to. 
train_hindifullfemale_03971| The princess immediately realised that this man was not the warrior she saw in the day and asked him to leave the palace at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_03972| She made sure that he climbed back the way he came. 
train_hindifullfemale_03973| Prapta left the place and slept that night in a rundown temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_03974| The sheriff of the city came to the same temple where he had arranged to meet a woman of vice. 
train_hindifullfemale_03975| He saw Prapta sleeping there and to keep his meeting a secret, he asked Prapta who he was. 
train_hindifullfemale_03976| Prapta recited the verse about destiny. 
train_hindifullfemale_03977| The sheriff then said, Sir, this is a bad place to sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_03978| You can go to my house and sleep there tonight in my place. 
train_hindifullfemale_03979| The merchant's son agreed to the proposal. 
train_hindifullfemale_03980| At the sheriff's house, his young and beautiful daughter Vinayawati had asked her lover to come and meet her secretly there in the night. 
train_hindifullfemale_03981| When Prapta came there following the sheriff's advice, Vinayawati mistook him in the darkness for her lover. 
train_hindifullfemale_03982| She arranged a feast for him and married him according to Gandharva tradition. 
train_hindifullfemale_03983| Noticing that Prapta did not utter a word, the sheriff's daughter asked him to say something. 
train_hindifullfemale_03984| Prapta recited his usual verse. 
train_hindifullfemale_03985| Vinayawati realised her mistake and asked him to leave at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_03986| As Prapta once again took to the street, he saw a marriage procession entering the city led by the bridegroom. 
train_hindifullfemale_03987| He joined in that procession. 
train_hindifullfemale_03988| The bride was the daughter of a very wealthy merchant of the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_03989| This procession reached the wedding hall sometime before the scheduled time for the wedding. 
train_hindifullfemale_03990| The bride's father set up a costly and gaily decorated dais for the wedding. 
train_hindifullfemale_03991| The bridal party came to the scene of wedding a bit in advance. 
train_hindifullfemale_03992| In the meantime, an elephant went berserk and killing the mahout headed for the marriage venue. 
train_hindifullfemale_03993| The bridegroom and his party joined the frightened people who were fleeing the scene of marriage. 
train_hindifullfemale_03994| Prapta happened to see the frightened bride alone and abandoned on the dais shivering in fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_03995| He jumped on to the dais and told the merchant's daughter that she need not fear for her life and that he would save her at any cost. 
train_hindifullfemale_03996| With great courage and presence of mind he approached the elephant with a stick and began to threaten him. 
train_hindifullfemale_03997| The elephant luckily left the scene. 
train_hindifullfemale_03998| Prapta took the bride's hand into his as a token of assurance. 
train_hindifullfemale_03999| When peace returned, groom and his friends and relatives also returned to the dais and seeing the bride's hand in the hand of a stranger. 
train_hindifullfemale_04000| Then the groom addressed the merchant, Sir, you have pledged the hand of your daughter to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04001| But I see that you have given her away to someone else, This is improper. 
train_hindifullfemale_04002| The merchant replied, My son, I do not know anything. 
train_hindifullfemale_04003| I also ran away from the dais. 
train_hindifullfemale_04004| Let me ask my daughter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04005| The daughter told her father, This brave man saved me from the mad elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04006| He is my saviour, I won't marry anyone but him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04007| It was now dawn and hearing the commotion the royal princess also came to the wedding venue to see what happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_04008| The sheriff's daughter also came there learning what had happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_04009| The king also came there and asked Prapta to tell him everything without fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_04010| Prapta as usual recited the verse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04011| This verse rang a bell in the princess head. 
train_hindifullfemale_04012| She remembered what happened in the night and thought Even God cannot undo what is destined. 
train_hindifullfemale_04013| The sheriff's daughter also recalled the events of the night and thought There is nothing to regret nor cause for surprise. 
train_hindifullfemale_04014| Listening to what Prapta said, the merchant's daughter also thought nobody can take away what destiny gives me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04015| The king now knew everything and the mystery of the verse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04016| He then gave away thousand villages to Prapta as gift. 
train_hindifullfemale_04017| He also crowned Prapta as the ruler of those villages. 
train_hindifullfemale_04018| The sheriff also married his daughter to Prapta. 
train_hindifullfemale_04019| The merchant's son lived happily ever after with his wives. 
train_hindifullfemale_04020| Rat, the mouse, thus ended his story of troubles and said, Even God cannot undo What is destined. 
train_hindifullfemale_04021| There is nothing to regret Nor cause for surprise. 
train_hindifullfemale_04022| Nobody can take away What destiny gives me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04023| I am disillusioned. 
train_hindifullfemale_04024| That is why my friend crow brought me to you, said the mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04025| Addressing the mouse, the turtle said, rat, the crow is your true friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_04026| Though he was hungry and you were his meal, he did not kill you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04027| On the other hand, he brought you here on his back. 
train_hindifullfemale_04028| You must make a friend of him who is uncorrupted by wealth and who stands by you in time of trouble. 
train_hindifullfemale_04029| The turtle continued, Therefore, stay here without fear or hesitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_04030| Forget the loss of wealth and shelter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04031| Remember, the shade of a passing cloud, friendship of the wicked, a cooked meal, youth and wealth do not stay for long. 
train_hindifullfemale_04032| Learned men are never attached to wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_04033| It does not come with you even for a few feet in your last journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_04034| There is a lot of pain in earning money and protecting it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04035| Money, therefore, brings grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_04036| What is not ours will not stay with us. 
train_hindifullfemale_04037| Haven't you heard the story of Soman who earned a lot of wealth but could not keep it? 
train_hindifullfemale_04038| Rat asked turtle to narrate the story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04039| Turtle began telling rat the story of the unlucky weaver. 
train_hindifullfemale_04040| Soman was a weaver living on the edge of the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_04041| He was an expert at making fine garments worthy of kings and princes. 
train_hindifullfemale_04042| He enjoyed the patronage of the nobility. 
train_hindifullfemale_04043| Despite all this, he was poorer than those weavers who were making coarse cloth for the common people. 
train_hindifullfemale_04044| Worried at his condition, he told his wife, Look dear, how rich these weavers of coarse cloth have become. 
train_hindifullfemale_04045| There is something wrong with this place. 
train_hindifullfemale_04046| I am not a success here. 
train_hindifullfemale_04047| I will go elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_04048| No dear, It is not true that you can be successful elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_04049| Our luck is linked to what we have done in a previous birth. 
train_hindifullfemale_04050| If you have done a good deed in your previous birth, you will reap the harvest in this birth without your effort. 
train_hindifullfemale_04051| If you do not have it in your destiny, you will not get it even with effort. 
train_hindifullfemale_04052| Just as sun and shade are inseparable, cause and effect are also linked to each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_04053| Soman did not agree with her. 
train_hindifullfemale_04054| He said, Without effort, you cannot achieve nothing. 
train_hindifullfemale_04055| Without cause there is no effect. 
train_hindifullfemale_04056| Even if you get a good meal as a result of a good deed in the past, you have to use your hand to eat it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04057| Wealth comes to a person who toils. 
train_hindifullfemale_04058| There is no point in chanting the name of God. 
train_hindifullfemale_04059| You must do your bit first. 
train_hindifullfemale_04060| If you are not successful despite your effort, you are not to blame. 
train_hindifullfemale_04061| Therefore, I have decided to go abroad. 
train_hindifullfemale_04062| Ignoring his wife's please, soman left his place and reached a far away city. 
train_hindifullfemale_04063| Working day and night, he earned three hundred gold sovereigns within three years. 
train_hindifullfemale_04064| He thought he should go home now and started the homeward trek. 
train_hindifullfemale_04065| At dusk he found himself in the middle of a forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04066| Wild animals began their hunt for prey. 
train_hindifullfemale_04067| The weaver climbed a tall tree and went to sleep on a big branch. 
train_hindifullfemale_04068| He saw a dream, The God of Action and the God of Destiny were talking to each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_04069| Destiny asked Action, The weaver is not destined to live in luxury. 
train_hindifullfemale_04070| Why did you give him three hundred sovereigns? 
train_hindifullfemale_04071| Action replied, I have to give to those who try and toil. 
train_hindifullfemale_04072| Whether the weaver can keep it or not is in your hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_04073| The dream jolted the weaver. 
train_hindifullfemale_04074| He looked into his bag and found the sovereigns missing. 
train_hindifullfemale_04075| Heart broken, soman began crying, I have lost what I had earned in three years with great effort. 
train_hindifullfemale_04076| I have become a poor man again. 
train_hindifullfemale_04077| I cannot go home in this condition and show my face to my wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04078| He saw no point in brooding over what has happened and decided to go to the city back and try again. 
train_hindifullfemale_04079| This time, he could collect five hundred sovereigns in one year. 
train_hindifullfemale_04080| He stored all this money in a small bag and began his homeward journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_04081| When it was sundown, he had already entered a forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04082| This time, he did not sleep, afraid that he would lose his money. 
train_hindifullfemale_04083| He continued to walk through the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04084| This time also he saw those two persons he saw earlier in his dream coming in his direction. 
train_hindifullfemale_04085| They repeated the same conversation about God rewarding a hardworking person and destiny denying it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04086| He immediately looked into his bag and found there was no gold in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04087| This time soman lost his courage and thought he should commit suicide. 
train_hindifullfemale_04088| He made a strong rope with the fibres he found in the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04089| He tied one end of the rope to a high branch of the tree and made a noose of the other end. 
train_hindifullfemale_04090| Everything was ready for his suicide when he heard a voice in the skies. 
train_hindifullfemale_04091| Soman, do not be rash. 
train_hindifullfemale_04092| I am destiny who took away your wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_04093| I cannot give you more than what is necessary for your bare needs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04094| Not a single cent more. 
train_hindifullfemale_04095| But I am pleased with your adventurous spirit. 
train_hindifullfemale_04096| Ask for a boon, I shall give it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04097| Please give me lots of wealth, said the weaver. 
train_hindifullfemale_04098| What do you do with so much money, asked the voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_04099| The weaver replied, People serve him who is rich even if he is a miser. 
train_hindifullfemale_04100| In that case, go back to city where two wealthy merchants, Gupta and Muktha are doing business. 
train_hindifullfemale_04101| After studying them well, decide who you want to become. 
train_hindifullfemale_04102| Gupta, the man who earns a lot of money but does not spend a cent of it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04103| Muktha, the man who earns but also enjoys the wealth he has amassed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04104| Soman followed their advice and went back to the city reaching the place in the evening after a tiring journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_04105| With great difficulty he traced Gupta's house and entered it despite resistance from the merchant's family. 
train_hindifullfemale_04106| When the time for dinner came, the merchant grudgingly gave food to soman, suggesting that he was an unwanted guest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04107| The weaver found a corner in the house where he could sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_04108| Soman again had the same dream in which Action and Destiny were debating Gupta giving food to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04109| Destiny told Action, You have made Gupta give food to soman. 
train_hindifullfemale_04110| Action said, You cannot blame me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04111| I had to ensure that Soman was fed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04112| It is for you to decide who deserved what. 
train_hindifullfemale_04113| Next day, Destiny saw to it that Gupta had an attack of cholera and had to miss his meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_04114| In this manner what was given away was saved. 
train_hindifullfemale_04115| Later, soman visited Muktha's house where the host welcomed him with great love and respect. 
train_hindifullfemale_04116| The weaver had a good meal and slept. 
train_hindifullfemale_04117| He had a dream as usual, the same two figures appearing in the dream. 
train_hindifullfemale_04118| Destiny told Action, Action, the host has spent a lot of money to entertain soman. 
train_hindifullfemale_04119| He even borrowed to make the guest happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04120| It is not in his destiny to have surplus. 
train_hindifullfemale_04121| How will he repay what he has borrowed? Action replied, My job is to see soman got what he deserved. 
train_hindifullfemale_04122| If Muktha crossed the limits in entertaining his guest, that is not my fault. 
train_hindifullfemale_04123| It is for you to decide what should be done. 
train_hindifullfemale_04124| Next day, a messenger from the royal household came to Muktha and gave him a big sum of money on behalf of the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04125| Soman thought, It is better to be like Muktha. 
train_hindifullfemale_04126| He enjoys life with whatever he has. 
train_hindifullfemale_04127| What's the use of being rich but miserly? I will better be Muktha. 
train_hindifullfemale_04128| Pleased, the Gods showered on him the wealth that he needed to enjoy life. 
train_hindifullfemale_04129| Turtle ended the story of soman telling rat and crow that a rich person who does not spend money is as poor as any poor person can be. 
train_hindifullfemale_04130| Not being able to enjoy is common to both the poor and the miserly rich. 
train_hindifullfemale_04131| Nothing on this earth is greater than charity and there is no greater enemy than miserliness. 
train_hindifullfemale_04132| The crow then advised rat, Listen to what the turtle is saying. 
train_hindifullfemale_04133| Elders have said that it is easier to get friends who talk sweetly but difficult to find friends who venture to tell you the truth however bitter it is. 
train_hindifullfemale_04134| The latter alone deserve to be called friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_04135| The crow and the mouse put a brake to their conversation when they saw a frightened deer darting towards the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04136| The crow flew to the top of a tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04137| The mouse scampered into his hole and the turtle sank into the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_04138| From the treetop, the crow could see the deer now clearly and told his other friends, Friends, he is only a deer who is thirsty. 
train_hindifullfemale_04139| These footfalls are not those of a man. 
train_hindifullfemale_04140| The turtle replied, The deer is panting. 
train_hindifullfemale_04141| It seems someone is chasing him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04142| He has not come to quench his thirst. 
train_hindifullfemale_04143| Surely, some hunter might be after him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04144| Please go to the top of the tree and look if you can find any hunter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04145| Assured that these are friends only, the deer, now said, Friend, you have guessed correctly. 
train_hindifullfemale_04146| I have escaped the arrow of the hunter and reached here with difficulty. 
train_hindifullfemale_04147| I am in search of a shelter the hunter cannot reach. 
train_hindifullfemale_04148| Please show me a place safe from the hunter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04149| The turtle said, the scriptures have mentioned two ways of escaping danger. 
train_hindifullfemale_04150| One is to use your muscle power and another is to run as fast as you can. 
train_hindifullfemale_04151| Now, run into the forest before the hunter could come. 
train_hindifullfemale_04152| That is not necessary, said crow, the crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04153| I have seen the hunters taking a good catch of food and going the way they came. 
train_hindifullfemale_04154| Turtle, you can now come out of the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_04155| Now all three of them with the deer became friends, happily spending time in each other's company. 
train_hindifullfemale_04156| The learned have said that when you have plenty of cordial conversation, the man who has no store of good words is not capable of uttering them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04157| One day, deer had not come when the other three had gathered at the lakeside for their daily discourse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04158| They thought, Poor deer has not come so far. 
train_hindifullfemale_04159| Is it possible that a lion or a hunter has killed him? 
train_hindifullfemale_04160| Or, is it possible that he has fallen into a pit? 
train_hindifullfemale_04161| Well wishers naturally suspect the worst when their near and dear ones are not seen for a while. 
train_hindifullfemale_04162| Turtle told the crow, Friend, you know neither rat nor I can move fast. 
train_hindifullfemale_04163| You alone can fly and see more things than we can. 
train_hindifullfemale_04164| Please go immediately and find out what is happening to our friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_04165| The crow did not fly too long before he saw deer trapped in a hunter's net near a small pond. 
train_hindifullfemale_04166| Moved by his plight, the crow said, Friend, what happened to you? 
train_hindifullfemale_04167| Trying to check tears in his eyes, the deer said, Death is chasing me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04168| It is good that you came to see me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04169| The crow said, Friend, do not lose courage when we are here. 
train_hindifullfemale_04170| I will rush back and bring rat here. 
train_hindifullfemale_04171| Crow flew fast to where the mouse and the turtle were anxiously waiting for him to come. 
train_hindifullfemale_04172| The crow then told them what happened to the deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_04173| On hearing his account, rat immediately decided that he should go and bite off the strings of the hunter's net. 
train_hindifullfemale_04174| He got on to the back of the crow and together they flew to the spot where the deer lay helplessly in the hunter's net. 
train_hindifullfemale_04175| When the deer saw his friends rushing to his aid, he realised how necessary it was to collect good friends and how nobody could overcome troubles without the help of good friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_04176| Rat asked the deer, How did you, such a learned being, get into this hole? 
train_hindifullfemale_04177| The deer replied, Friend, this is not a time for a debate. 
train_hindifullfemale_04178| The hunter may come any time. 
train_hindifullfemale_04179| First, get me out of this net. 
train_hindifullfemale_04180| The mouse laughed and said, Why are you scared of the hunter when I am here? 
train_hindifullfemale_04181| But tell me how did you let yourself trapped in this way? 
train_hindifullfemale_04182| The deer replied, Friend, when luck is not with you, you will lose discretion. 
train_hindifullfemale_04183| As the elders say when death is lurking for you and when wickedness overtakes you, your thoughts too take a crooked path. 
train_hindifullfemale_04184| Nobody can save you from what God has in store for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04185| As they were discussing their plan to escape, crow and rat saw that the turtle also was coming. 
train_hindifullfemale_04186| The crow said, Look, this slow footed guy is coming. 
train_hindifullfemale_04187| Neither can we save the deer or ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_04188| See this fellow's foolishness. 
train_hindifullfemale_04189| If the hunter comes, I can fly away and you can beat a fast retreat. 
train_hindifullfemale_04190| But how can this turtle escape? 
train_hindifullfemale_04191| The hunter came when they were debating this point. 
train_hindifullfemale_04192| The mouse did a fast job of biting off the strings of the net and the deer rushed into the thick forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04193| The mouse too disappeared into the nearest hole. 
train_hindifullfemale_04194| But the poor turtle was slowly plodding its way to safety. 
train_hindifullfemale_04195| But the hunter saw him and bound him to his bow and slung it across his shoulder and began going home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04196| Rat saw this from a distance and began reflecting, Troubles do not come in singles. 
train_hindifullfemale_04197| I have already lost everything I have. 
train_hindifullfemale_04198| I have lost my relatives and my retinue. 
train_hindifullfemale_04199| Now, this loss of a great friend! We come close to each other only to part. 
train_hindifullfemale_04200| Everything in this world is temporary. 
train_hindifullfemale_04201| Yet, I am grateful to God, for, he has created this sweet relationship we call friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_04202| Meanwhile, the deer and the crow came, disturbing the mouse's reverie. 
train_hindifullfemale_04203| Recovering, rat said, Let's not brood over the past. 
train_hindifullfemale_04204| Let us first look for a way to rescue the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04205| The crow said, Listen, and do as I tell you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04206| Deer will go to a small lake on the hunter's way home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04207| He should pretend he is dead and I will sit on his head and pretend pecking his eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_04208| Seeing the motionless deer, the hunter will then rest the turtle on the ground and reach for the deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_04209| Rat should at once reach the turtle and bite off the strings binding him to the bow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04210| All right, we will do as you say, said the mouse and the deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_04211| Meanwhile, the hunter, seeing the motionless deer, thought it was dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_04212| Leaving the turtle on the ground, he came to the deer. 
train_hindifullfemale_04213| The deer at once ran away and the crow flew away. 
train_hindifullfemale_04214| At the other end, the mouse bit off the strings binding the turtle to the bow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04215| The turtle entered water and the mouse ran to his hole. 
train_hindifullfemale_04216| Disappointed, the hunter returned to where he had rested the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04217| When he found that the turtle had escaped, he cried bitterly and went home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04218| After making sure that they were far away from the hunter's reach, the four friends gathered and celebrated their reunion. 
train_hindifullfemale_04219| Concluding his discourse, rat said, It is a lesson to mankind on the value of friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_04220| One should not try to cheat friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_04221| The elders have said that he who is faithful to his friends shall never taste defeat. 
train_hindifullfemale_04222| Thus we come to the end of the second part called Gaining Friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_04223| This third part of the story begins with a verse, Trust not even a close friend Who earlier, was your enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04224| This is the story of how the crows burnt the home of a trusting pack of owls. 
train_hindifullfemale_04225| Once upon a time all the crows in a town made a huge banyan tree their home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04226| The tree had hundreds of branches. 
train_hindifullfemale_04227| Their king, set up strong fortifications to ensure security. 
train_hindifullfemale_04228| Similarly, the owls of the town made a nearby cave their colony. 
train_hindifullfemale_04229| They also had a king, who ruled with the help of a strong and cunning army. 
train_hindifullfemale_04230| The owl king kept a close eye on the banyan tree and on account of previous enmity killed every night any crow he sighted outside the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04231| Slowly, the owl king managed to kill all crows that could be seen outside the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04232| That is why wise men had always said that whoever neglects disease or the enemy perishes in their hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_04233| Alarmed at the loss of his flock, Crow king assembled his ministers and asked them to prepare a plan to fight the owls. 
train_hindifullfemale_04234| He placed before them six strategies and asked them to name the best of the six. 
train_hindifullfemale_04235| The first minister suggested compromise as a tactic because one had first to survive to gather strength and later destroy the enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04236| The elders have said, bend to the enemy when he is strong Attack him when he is vulnerable. 
train_hindifullfemale_04237| Do not wage a war if it doesn't bring Power, or wealth or friendship. 
train_hindifullfemale_04238| The second minister ruled out compromise and offered trickery as a formula. 
train_hindifullfemale_04239| He cited the example of how Bheema in the Mahabharata had killed an evil soul in the disguise of a woman. 
train_hindifullfemale_04240| He also quoted, Never accept peace with An enemy who is not just, For, he will break his word and stab you in the back. 
train_hindifullfemale_04241| The minister referred to the learned as saying that it is easy to defeat an enemy who is a tyrant, a miser, an idler, a liar, a coward and a fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_04242| Words of peace will only inflame an enemy blinded by anger. 
train_hindifullfemale_04243| The third minister said, lord, our enemy is not only strong but also wicked. 
train_hindifullfemale_04244| Neither compromise nor trickery will work with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04245| Exile is the best way. 
train_hindifullfemale_04246| We shall wait and strike when the enemy becomes weak. 
train_hindifullfemale_04247| Neither peace nor brave can subdue a strong enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04248| Where these two do not work Flight is the best alternative. 
train_hindifullfemale_04249| The fourth minister opposed all these tactics and suggested the king of crows should stay in his own fort, mobilize support from friends and then attack the enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04250| He quoted the learned as saying, A king who flees is like A cobra without fangs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04251| A crocodile in water can haul an elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04252| Therefore, the minister said, An ally is what wind is to fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_04253| The king must stay where he is and gather allies for support. 
train_hindifullfemale_04254| The fifth minister offered a strategy similar to that of the fourth and said, Stay in your fort and seek the help of an ally stronger than the enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04255| It also pays to form an axis of less strong allies. 
train_hindifullfemale_04256| After listening to all the ministers, Crow king turned to the wisest and senior most among his counsels, and asked him for his advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_04257| The wise man told Crow king, king of crows, this is the time to use duplicity to finish the enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04258| You can thus keep your throne. 
train_hindifullfemale_04259| But learned sir, we have no idea of where owl king lives and of what his failings are. 
train_hindifullfemale_04260| That is not difficult. 
train_hindifullfemale_04261| Send your spies and gather information on the key men advising the king of owls. 
train_hindifullfemale_04262| The next step is to divide them by setting one against the other. 
train_hindifullfemale_04263| Tell me why did the crows and owls fall out in the first place, asked Crow king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04264| Old wise crow said, That is another story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04265| Long, long ago all the birds in the jungle like swans, parrots, cranes, nightingales, owls, peacocks, pigeons, pheasants, sparrows, crows etc. 
train_hindifullfemale_04266| All assembled and expressed anguish that their king vulture had become indifferent to their welfare and failed to save them from poachers. 
train_hindifullfemale_04267| Believing that people without a protector were like passengers in a ship without a captain, they decided to elect a new king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04268| They chose an owl as their king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04269| As the owl was being crowned, a crow flew into the assembly and asked them why and what they were celebrating. 
train_hindifullfemale_04270| When the birds told him the details, the crow told them, the owl is a wicked and ugly bird and it is unwise to choose another leader when vulture is still alive. 
train_hindifullfemale_04271| To crush enemies it is enough if you mentioned vulture's name or for that matter the name of anyone who is great. 
train_hindifullfemale_04272| That was how the hares managed to live happily by taking the name of the moon. 
train_hindifullfemale_04273| The birds asked the visiting crow, Tell us how this has happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_04274| I will tell you, said the crow and began telling them the story of the hares and the elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_04275| Once upon a time a great elephant ruled over a vast stretch of forest as the king of his subjects. 
train_hindifullfemale_04276| They were not happy because for several years there had been no rains and all the lakes, tanks, ponds and water holes in the forest became arid. 
train_hindifullfemale_04277| The subjects went in a delegation to the king and appealed to him, mighty king, there is no water to drink in the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04278| Many of the younger ones are on the verge of extinction. 
train_hindifullfemale_04279| Please look for a lake full of water and save us. 
train_hindifullfemale_04280| The king told them, I know of a hidden lake that is always full of water. 
train_hindifullfemale_04281| Let us go there and save ourselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_04282| The elephants then set off for the hidden lake and after plodding through the jungle for five nights reached the great lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04283| They colonised the land around the lake and once again started their revelry in water. 
train_hindifullfemale_04284| But as the elephants daily marched their way to the lake, they trampled upon hundreds of hares that made the land around the lake their home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04285| Hundreds of them died and thousands more were maimed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04286| One day the hares assembled to chalk out a plan to save themselves from the menace of the wayward elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_04287| An older one among them said, these elephants will come every day and every day many of us will die. 
train_hindifullfemale_04288| We must find a solution to this problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_04289| A wiser one, among them said, The great Man had said that it was better to abandon a person to save the whole community, abandon the community to save the village and abandon the village to save the country. 
train_hindifullfemale_04290| Even if the land were fertile, a wise king would abandon it if it were in the interests of his subjects. 
train_hindifullfemale_04291| But the other hares protested and said, How can we do that? We have been living here for several generations. 
train_hindifullfemale_04292| Let us find an alternative. 
train_hindifullfemale_04293| Let us see if we can scare the elephants by some means. 
train_hindifullfemale_04294| Some of them said, We know of a trick that works with the elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_04295| However, we need a very intelligent person. 
train_hindifullfemale_04296| Pressed to reveal the plan, they said, Our ruler lives in the lunar sphere. 
train_hindifullfemale_04297| Let us send a messenger to the elephant king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04298| The plan is to tell the elephant king that the Moon does not like the elephants visiting the lake for water because they are killing and maiming hundreds of hares. 
train_hindifullfemale_04299| The Moon has declared the lake out of bounds for the elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_04300| Some others agreed and said, Yes, there is a hare whose name is White. 
train_hindifullfemale_04301| He can do the job with success. 
train_hindifullfemale_04302| After a lot of discussions, the hares decided to send White to the elephant king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04303| Addressing the king, White said, heartless king, I live in the lunar sphere. 
train_hindifullfemale_04304| The Moon has sent me as envoy to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04305| This lake belongs to the Moon. 
train_hindifullfemale_04306| He has forbidden all of you from drinking water from the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04307| So, go back, But where is your lord, the Moon, asked, the elephant king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04308| White said, He is very much in this lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04309| He has come to console the survivors of your rampage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04310| Then, let me see him, the elephant king challenged the envoy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04311| Come alone with me, I will show you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04312| Let us go then, said the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04313| White took the elephant king one night to the lake and showed the reflection of the Moon in the lake and said, Here he is, our King, the Moon. 
train_hindifullfemale_04314| He is lost in meditation. 
train_hindifullfemale_04315| Move quietly and salute him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04316| Otherwise, you will disturb his meditation and bring upon you his wrath. 
train_hindifullfemale_04317| Taking him for the real Moon, the elephant king saluted him and left quietly. 
train_hindifullfemale_04318| The hares breathed a sigh of relief and lived happily ever after. 
train_hindifullfemale_04319| The crow told the birds gathered to elect a leader, that is why it is important to choose a wise and experienced person as your leader. 
train_hindifullfemale_04320| If you do not, listen to this story of how a hare and a partridge destroyed themselves because they chose a wicked mediator. 
train_hindifullfemale_04321| Very interesting, said the birds and asked the visiting crow to tell them the account of the mediator. 
train_hindifullfemale_04322| The visiting crow began narrating the story, The Cunning Mediator. 
train_hindifullfemale_04323| A sparrow was living in the hollow of a big tree that I had made my home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04324| We became good friends and used to spend our time discussing characters in our literature and the unusual things we saw in our travels. 
train_hindifullfemale_04325| One day, my friend left the tree with other sparrows in search of food and did not return even after nightfall. 
train_hindifullfemale_04326| I began to worry, What happened to him? Did any hunter take him away? 
train_hindifullfemale_04327| He never leaves my company even for a while. 
train_hindifullfemale_04328| Days passed without any trace of my friend Sparrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04329| One fine morning, a hare, came and silently occupied the hollow that my friend made his home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04330| It did not worry me because there was no word about Sparrow and I had lost all hopes of his return. 
train_hindifullfemale_04331| But one day, he returned looking healthier than he was when he had left and found that the hare had taken his place. 
train_hindifullfemale_04332| Sparrow told the hare, hare, what you have done is improper. 
train_hindifullfemale_04333| You have displaced me, Leave the place immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_04334| Hare hit back saying, What are you talking? This is my place. 
train_hindifullfemale_04335| Haven't you the heard saying, that nobody has rights over a public well, a temple, a pond and a tree? 
train_hindifullfemale_04336| Whoever enjoys land for more than ten years also becomes its owner. 
train_hindifullfemale_04337| That needs no evidence or documents of proof. 
train_hindifullfemale_04338| This place is not yours any more. 
train_hindifullfemale_04339| The sparrow told him, you are quoting legal scriptures! Let us go to an expert in law and ethics. 
train_hindifullfemale_04340| We will abide by his ruling. 
train_hindifullfemale_04341| The hare agreed to this proposal and both of them went in search of an expert. 
train_hindifullfemale_04342| Curious to see what would happen, I also followed them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04343| Meanwhile, word about their quarrel had reached a wicked and wild cat. 
train_hindifullfemale_04344| Knowing the routine that the hare and the sparrow would take, the cat set up a camp, on the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_04345| He spread a mat of grass on the ground and went into a posture of meditation. 
train_hindifullfemale_04346| Facing the sun and raising his hands in worship, the cat began reciting scriptures. 
train_hindifullfemale_04347| This world has no essence, Life is passing. 
train_hindifullfemale_04348| All liaisons with lovers are like a dream. 
train_hindifullfemale_04349| Your ties with the family are illusory. 
train_hindifullfemale_04350| There is no alternative to following the right path. 
train_hindifullfemale_04351| The learned have said, This wretched body will soon perish. 
train_hindifullfemale_04352| Material wealth is not permanent. 
train_hindifullfemale_04353| Death is knocking at your door. 
train_hindifullfemale_04354| Free thyself from earthly chains. 
train_hindifullfemale_04355| He who abandons the right path. 
train_hindifullfemale_04356| Is the same as the living dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_04357| I will end this long discourse and tell you in a nutshell what the right path is. 
train_hindifullfemale_04358| Doing good to others is virtue. 
train_hindifullfemale_04359| Tormenting others is vice. 
train_hindifullfemale_04360| This is the essence of our philosophy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04361| On hearing this, the sparrow and hares trusted him as a wise person and put forth there problems to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04362| The cat smiled to himself satisfactorily and continued his play. 
train_hindifullfemale_04363| He said, I am in the service of God and have given up all desires. 
train_hindifullfemale_04364| I will not do you any harm. 
train_hindifullfemale_04365| After hearing your account, I will decide who among you is the rightful owner of the place in the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04366| But I am now very old and cannot hear you properly. 
train_hindifullfemale_04367| So, please come close to me and narrate your story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04368| When the poor and innocent sparrow and hare came within the reach of the cat, he pounced on them . 
train_hindifullfemale_04369| The cat grabbed the sparrow in his teeth and slashed the body of the hare with his jaws and killed them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04370| The visiting crow then told the birds, That is why I tell you if you rest your faith in this wicked and blind owl, You will meet the same end as the hare and the sparrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04371| The birds then dispersed, deciding to discuss the matter again carefully before electing the owl as the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04372| Meanwhile, the owl was sitting restlessly on the throne waiting for his coronation. 
train_hindifullfemale_04373| He asked his wife, What is all this delay in crowning me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04374| The wife told him, My lord, it is this crow which has sabotaged the coronation. 
train_hindifullfemale_04375| All the birds have dispersed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04376| Only this crow is lingering here. 
train_hindifullfemale_04377| Come, let us go, I will take you home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04378| Furious, the owl shouted at the crow, You wicked crow, what harm have I done to you? 
train_hindifullfemale_04379| You have wrecked the coronation. 
train_hindifullfemale_04380| This is enough reason that from today there shall be enmity between owls and crows. 
train_hindifullfemale_04381| One can heal wounds inflicted on the body but not the heart. 
train_hindifullfemale_04382| Dejected, the owl went home with his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04383| The crow began reflecting, what a foolish thing have I done? Unnecessarily, I have made enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_04384| I should not have advised the birds not to elect the owl as the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04385| Elders have aptly said, Words out of tune with times. 
train_hindifullfemale_04386| Words that bring grief in the end. 
train_hindifullfemale_04387| Words that bring pain to others. 
train_hindifullfemale_04388| Are, any day, as good as poison. 
train_hindifullfemale_04389| Regretting what he had said and done, the visiting crow also went home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04390| This is how enmity began between the owls and the crows. 
train_hindifullfemale_04391| After listening to the story, Crow king asked the old wise crow, What should we do in such a situation? 
train_hindifullfemale_04392| The old wise crow, told him, There is a strategy better than the six I had already told you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04393| With its help, I will myself go and conquer the owl king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04394| The learned have said that men with great common sense and a little bit of cunning can subdue stronger enemies like the tricksters who cheated the gullible Brahmin of his lamb. 
train_hindifullfemale_04395| On Crow king's request,old wise crow began telling him the Brahmin's story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04396| Now begins the story of a brahmin and the crooks. 
train_hindifullfemale_04397| Mitra Sharma was a Brahmin living in a small village. 
train_hindifullfemale_04398| He used to daily worship Fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_04399| It was the month of February. 
train_hindifullfemale_04400| The sky was full of clouds and it had already started raining. 
train_hindifullfemale_04401| Sharma left for a neighbouring village at that time to seek the gift of a sacrificial lamb from some rich man. 
train_hindifullfemale_04402| He called on a well to do man in the village and requested him to make him a gift of a healthy lamb for sacrifice to Gods. 
train_hindifullfemale_04403| The wealthy man gave him one of the well fed lambs he had. 
train_hindifullfemale_04404| Carrying the lamb on his shoulders, the Brahmin began his homeward journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_04405| Three crooks, very hungry and emaciated, crossed his path and seeing the healthy lamb on the Brahmin's shoulders thought, God has sent us good food. 
train_hindifullfemale_04406| Let us trick the Sharma into parting with it and free us from hunger and cold. 
train_hindifullfemale_04407| At once, they began to act. 
train_hindifullfemale_04408| One of them changed into a disguise, and overtaking the Sharma by another route, stopped him and said, what a fool you are? 
train_hindifullfemale_04409| Such a great worshipper of Fire, why are you carrying this dog on your shoulders? This will bring you ridicule. 
train_hindifullfemale_04410| Do not you know that it is a sin to touch a dog, or a rooster, or a donkey? 
train_hindifullfemale_04411| The Brahmin lost his temper and said, You stupid fellow, are you blind? Why do you call a lamb a dog? 
train_hindifullfemale_04412| The first crook replied, Do not be angry, if you think he is not a dog, please carry on, I have no objection. 
train_hindifullfemale_04413| The Brahmin hardly walked a little distance. 
train_hindifullfemale_04414| Then the second crook greeted him and said, respected sir, it is highly regrettable that you are carrying a dead calf on your shoulders, however dear it is to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04415| The man who touches dead animals or birds has to undergo purification rites. 
train_hindifullfemale_04416| The Brahmin challenged him, Are you too blind? 
train_hindifullfemale_04417| This is a live sacrificial lamb and you say he is a dead calf. 
train_hindifullfemale_04418| The second crook said, All right, sir. 
train_hindifullfemale_04419| Please excuse me, I am an ignorant fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_04420| Do as it pleases you Now it was the turn of the third crook to cross the Brahmin's path. 
train_hindifullfemale_04421| Turning to the Brahmin, the crook said, Sir, it is highly improper. 
train_hindifullfemale_04422| You are carrying a donkey on your shoulders, This is not done. 
train_hindifullfemale_04423| The elders have said he who touches a donkey, knowingly or otherwise, has to take a bath fully dressed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04424| So, please leave him before anybody notices it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04425| Thinking that he was really carrying a donkey, the poor Brahmin threw the lamb to the ground and went home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04426| Old wise crow, continuing his advice to Crow king, said, There is hardly any person who is not misled. 
train_hindifullfemale_04427| The servility of a new servant or The sweet words of a guest or The mock tears of a wily woman. 
train_hindifullfemale_04428| Also, remember not to quarrel with weak men when they are united because they cannot be defeated. 
train_hindifullfemale_04429| See, for example, how a deadly snake becomes prey of a united army of ants. 
train_hindifullfemale_04430| That is why I want to tell you a few words of caution. 
train_hindifullfemale_04431| Follow them, We shall do as you command us, said Crow king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04432| Old wise crow then began revealing his plan, Apart from the four strategies I had told you, there is a fifth one. 
train_hindifullfemale_04433| In the presence of everyone, abuse me and punish me branding me as the friend of your enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04434| That will convince the spies of our enemy that you do not trust me any more. 
train_hindifullfemale_04435| Bring some blood and spray it on my body. 
train_hindifullfemale_04436| Then exile me to the nearby hills. 
train_hindifullfemale_04437| I shall remain here bruised and when the enemy comes, I will try to earn his mercy and trust by blaming you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04438| You stay in the hills till I find their fort and give you a signal when all the owls are sleeping in the day. 
train_hindifullfemale_04439| Then you can come and with the help of your army kill all the owls. 
train_hindifullfemale_04440| This plan is the result of great thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_04441| We have no alternative. 
train_hindifullfemale_04442| On Crow king approving the plan, old wise crow started a mock fight with the king of crows. 
train_hindifullfemale_04443| The king's men and others, mistaking it for a real duel, were ready to kill old wise crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04444| Crow king told them, Do not interfere, Go away. 
train_hindifullfemale_04445| I will have the pleasure of punishing this unfaithful fellow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04446| Crow king then pretended to attack old wise crow with his beak and doused him in blood he brought with him and left for the hills. 
train_hindifullfemale_04447| Then wife of Owl King who was spying on the crow camp, carried this news of the assault on minister wise old crow and the king's departure for the hills, to the owl king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04448| Soon after sunset, the owl king, accompanied by his ministers and followers, set out to kill all the crows. 
train_hindifullfemale_04449| They reached the tree, home of the crows, and surrounded it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04450| Not finding a single crow there and happy for that reason, owl king told his men to look for the crows so that they could chase them and kill them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04451| Meanwhile,old wise crow, who suffered mock injuries, began weakly moaning to attract the attention of the owls. 
train_hindifullfemale_04452| When the owls saw this and rushed to kill him, he pleaded, Sir, my name is old wise crow and I am a minister of the Crow king, the king of crows. 
train_hindifullfemale_04453| Before you kill me, I have something to convey to your king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04454| Owl king came to see the minister at once and asked him the reason for his plight. 
train_hindifullfemale_04455| Old wise crow told him, Our king wanted to avenge the massacre of his subjects by your men. 
train_hindifullfemale_04456| When I knew he was bent upon waging a war with you, I advised him not to be rash and not go to war with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04457| I asked him to sign peace with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04458| My king thought that I was on your side and in great anger inflicted these injuries on me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04459| As soon as I recover, I will show you where he and his men are hiding. 
train_hindifullfemale_04460| You can destroy them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04461| The king of owls called a meeting of his elders and his five ministers for consultations. 
train_hindifullfemale_04462| He asked his first minister, Friend, our enemy's minister is in our custody. 
train_hindifullfemale_04463| What shall we do with him? The minister said, What is there to discuss? Kill him instantly without hesitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_04464| It is always better to destroy the enemy before he acquires strength. 
train_hindifullfemale_04465| Such opportunities come once in a while. 
train_hindifullfemale_04466| If you lose it now, you will never get it back. 
train_hindifullfemale_04467| Do not be carried away by Crow minister's show of affection. 
train_hindifullfemale_04468| Because once lost, love never returns. 
train_hindifullfemale_04469| To drive home the point, owl minister related to the king of owls the story of a cobra and a Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_04470| Haridatta was a Brahmin living in a hamlet. 
train_hindifullfemale_04471| He was a farmer but the piece of land he cultivated gave him very little to survive. 
train_hindifullfemale_04472| One day, unable to stand the heat of the summer sun, he went to a big tree in his land to rest for a while. 
train_hindifullfemale_04473| Before he could spread himself on the ground he saw in the nearby anthill a huge cobra swaying with his hood open. 
train_hindifullfemale_04474| He thought, This cobra must really be the Goddess of this land. 
train_hindifullfemale_04475| I have never worshipped her, which is why I am not able to get anything from the land. 
train_hindifullfemale_04476| From today, I will worship her. 
train_hindifullfemale_04477| At once he went back to his village and returned with a glass full of milk. 
train_hindifullfemale_04478| He poured it in a bowl and turning to the anthill said, ruler of the land, I did not know you were living in this anthill. 
train_hindifullfemale_04479| That is why I have not paid my tribute to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04480| Please excuse me and accept this humble offering. 
train_hindifullfemale_04481| He then placed the bowl of milk at the anthill and left the place. 
train_hindifullfemale_04482| Next day when the Brahmin came to his land before the Sun was up, he saw a gold coin in the bowl he had left at the anthill. 
train_hindifullfemale_04483| Henceforth, he came alone every dawn, collected the coin, offered the milk in the bowl and left. 
train_hindifullfemale_04484| One day the Brahmin, leaving for another village on business, asked his son to go to the ant hill and offer milk. 
train_hindifullfemale_04485| When the son went the next day, he found a gold coin in the bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_04486| He collected the coin and thought, This anthill must be full of gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_04487| If I kill the cobra, I can collect all the gold in one go instead of coming here every day. 
train_hindifullfemale_04488| He then struck the cobra with a big stick. 
train_hindifullfemale_04489| But the cobra deftly dodged the blow but stung the son to death with his poisonous fangs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04490| Returning to his village the next day, Haridatta heard the story of his son's death and at once realised that greed was behind it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04491| The Brahmin went to the anthill the day after his son's cremation and offered milk to the cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_04492| Without coming out of his hole, the cobra told Haridatta, You have come here for gold forgetting that you had lost a son and that you were in mourning. 
train_hindifullfemale_04493| The reason is greed, pure greed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04494| From today, there is no meaning in our relationship. 
train_hindifullfemale_04495| Blinded by his youth, your son has struck me and I bit him back. 
train_hindifullfemale_04496| How can I forget that blow? How can you suffer the grief of your son's death? 
train_hindifullfemale_04497| Finally, I am giving you this diamond, do not come back again. 
train_hindifullfemale_04498| Ending the story of the Brahmin and the cobra, the minister told owl king, The lesson is that love once betrayed cannot be regained. 
train_hindifullfemale_04499| If you kill this crow minister you will have no problems left. 
train_hindifullfemale_04500| After listening to his minister patiently, the king of owls turned to his second minister and asked him for his opinion. 
train_hindifullfemale_04501| The second minister said, my lord, I do not agree with the advice the first minister gave you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04502| It is very unkind, We should never kill a person seeking asylum. 
train_hindifullfemale_04503| There is a fine story about how, knowing that a hunter who sought shelter had in fact come to kill him, a dove offered himself as food to the hunter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04504| On the king asking him to relate that story, the second minister told him the following tale. 
train_hindifullfemale_04505| Once upon a time there lived a merciless hunter in the heart of a forest, terrorizing birds and animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_04506| Because of his cruel nature he had no friends or relatives. 
train_hindifullfemale_04507| The elders have said, It is unwise to be close to Men who are wicked and cruel. 
train_hindifullfemale_04508| Avoid such heinous persons as You avoid poisonous snakes. 
train_hindifullfemale_04509| The hunter went out into the forest every morning with a stick and net. 
train_hindifullfemale_04510| One day, he threw his net and trapped a female dove in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04511| Soon, thick and black clouds appeared in the sky and it began raining cats and dogs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04512| Scared and shivering, the hunter looked for shelter and found it under a huge banyan tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04513| The rain and wind stopped suddenly. 
train_hindifullfemale_04514| The skies became clear with stars shining. 
train_hindifullfemale_04515| The hunter said loudly, If there is anyone on the tree, I seek shelter and food from him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04516| I am hungry and may faint any moment, Please save me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04517| At the same time, a dove that had his nest on the same tree was worried that his wife who had gone out had not come back. 
train_hindifullfemale_04518| He prayed to Gods that his wife should not come to any harm in this wind and rain. 
train_hindifullfemale_04519| He began telling himself, Blessed and happy is the man With a caring and loving wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04520| A home is not a home without a wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04521| A wifeless home is like a jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04522| The wife trapped in the hunter's net heard her husband's sorrowful words. 
train_hindifullfemale_04523| Happy that her husband loved her so much, thought, Do not call her a woman Whose husband is unhappy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04524| Where happy husbands live, Heavens shower blessings. 
train_hindifullfemale_04525| Later, addressing her husband, the female dove said, Listen to me, my dear. 
train_hindifullfemale_04526| Even at the cost of your life, you must come to the rescue of someone seeking shelter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04527| This hunter is suffering from cold and hunger and has sought shelter under our tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04528| You must serve him with devotion. 
train_hindifullfemale_04529| Do not hate him because he has trapped your beloved wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04530| In reality, the strings of destiny have bound me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04531| Give up all thoughts of revenge and serve the hunter with care. 
train_hindifullfemale_04532| In accordance with his wife's desire, the dove suppressed grief and told the hunter, Sir, you are welcome to our modest home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04533| Please let me know what I can do for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04534| Treat this as your own home and feel free to command me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04535| The hunter told the dove that he was suffering from cold and needed relief. 
train_hindifullfemale_04536| The dove flew out, brought fire from somewhere, and lit a small fire with dry twigs and asked the hunter to warm himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_04537| The dove told the hunter, Because of my past deeds, I am born poor and unfortunate and do not have enough to feed myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_04538| What is the point in a host living if he cannot entertain a guest? It is better he renounce this world. 
train_hindifullfemale_04539| Yet he thought that it was better to die than say no to a host. 
train_hindifullfemale_04540| Determined to die, the dove told the hunter to wait for a while and that soon he will have food. 
train_hindifullfemale_04541| Then circling over the fire, the dove jumped into the fire he lit for the benefit of the hunter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04542| Moved by this sacrifice, the hunter told himself, I am responsible for this tragedy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04543| I will no doubt go to hell. 
train_hindifullfemale_04544| This dove is a great soul, he has shown me the right path. 
train_hindifullfemale_04545| Hereafter, I will give up all wants and desires and slowly destroy this body. 
train_hindifullfemale_04546| Nothing, neither cold nor sun nor wind, matters to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04547| I will fast and see my slow end. 
train_hindifullfemale_04548| The hunter then threw his net and stick and released the female dove from the net. 
train_hindifullfemale_04549| The wife then saw how her husband had jumped into the fire to provide food for the hunter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04550| She thought that life without her husband was worse than death and at once jumped into the same fire that consumed her husband. 
train_hindifullfemale_04551| After her death, she saw her husband in the heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_04552| On seeing her, the husband said, my darling, you have done well to follow me into the fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_04553| Women like you live happily with their husbands for thirty five million years. 
train_hindifullfemale_04554| The dove couple lived happily ever after. 
train_hindifullfemale_04555| The hunter, shunning worldly pleasures, went to a forest for realising God. 
train_hindifullfemale_04556| As penance had cleansed him of all desires, the hunter burnt himself in a forest fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_04557| After Second Minister ended telling the king the hunter's story, owl king asked a third minister,for his advice on dealing withold wise crow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04558| The minister told the king, My lord, old wise crow does not deserve to be killed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04559| He will be of use to us in revealing the secrets of the enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04560| There is this story of how even a thief could help an old man. 
train_hindifullfemale_04561| On the king commanding him, 3rd minister began telling him the story of the old man, his young wife and the thief. 
train_hindifullfemale_04562| The Tale of Two Snakes. 
train_hindifullfemale_04563| Once upon a time there was a king Deva. 
train_hindifullfemale_04564| He had a son who was very weak and growing weaker by the day. 
train_hindifullfemale_04565| It was found that he had a snake in his stomach. 
train_hindifullfemale_04566| Experts, physicians and surgeons tried to nurse him back to health without success. 
train_hindifullfemale_04567| Dejected, the son left his palace one night and took shelter in a lonely and dilapidated temple in another town ruled by another king named Bheesma. 
train_hindifullfemale_04568| Every day, the son would go out to beg and return to the temple in the night. 
train_hindifullfemale_04569| King Bheesma had two daughters who came of age. 
train_hindifullfemale_04570| Following a tradition, the two daughters would get up every dawn and touch the feet of their father in reverence. 
train_hindifullfemale_04571| One day, after paying respects to the king one of his daughters said, Victory to the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04572| We are happy in every way. 
train_hindifullfemale_04573| The second daughter said, king, reap the harvest of your actions. 
train_hindifullfemale_04574| The king, very angry at the words of the second daughter, called his ministers and told them 
train_hindifullfemale_04575| Take this foul mouthed woman away and marry her off to some stranger. 
train_hindifullfemale_04576| Let her reap the consequences of her actions. 
train_hindifullfemale_04577| In compliance with the orders of the king, the ministers took her away and married her without pomp or ceremony to Deva's son living in the old temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_04578| The daughter considered the king's son as God's gift and after persuading him, left for another country. 
train_hindifullfemale_04579| The princess and the son of Deva reached a city where they camped close to a lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04580| She asked her husband to take care of the camp and went into the city with her maids to buy daily needs like rice, salt, butter oil and vegetables. 
train_hindifullfemale_04581| After shopping, she returned to the lake where she saw a surprising spectacle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04582| The prince was sleeping, resting his head on an ant hill. 
train_hindifullfemale_04583| The serpent in his stomach came out to breath fresh air. 
train_hindifullfemale_04584| Then another serpent emerged from the anthill for the same reason. 
train_hindifullfemale_04585| Both of them glared at each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_04586| The anthill inmate said, You wicked creature, why do you torment such a handsome prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_04587| The other serpent retorted, Why are you polluting the two golden urns in your hole. 
train_hindifullfemale_04588| Thus in their row, they revealed the secrets of each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_04589| The serpent in the anthill told the other serpent, Do not be arrogant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04590| Who does not know the secret of your death? If the prince drinks a concoction made of gruel and mustard you will die unsung. 
train_hindifullfemale_04591| Is that so? You will also perish if someone pours hot oil or hot water in your ant hill. 
train_hindifullfemale_04592| Do not be too proud, said the serpent in the prince's stomach. 
train_hindifullfemale_04593| The princess, who heard all that passed between the two serpents. 
train_hindifullfemale_04594| She poured hot oil into the ant hill and took the two golden urns. 
train_hindifullfemale_04595| Gave the mustard mixture to her husband and killed the serpent inside his stomach. 
train_hindifullfemale_04596| Both Deva's son and his daughter in law returned to his kingdom and lived happily ever after. 
train_hindifullfemale_04597| After listening to this story, owl king accepted his advice that old wise crow's life should be spared. 
train_hindifullfemale_04598| The first minister, was sad and told the ministers, You have misled the king by giving wrong advice and paved the way for his destruction. 
train_hindifullfemale_04599| The learned have said that where wicked men are honoured and wise men are insulted, there will be fear, famine and death. 
train_hindifullfemale_04600| Disregarding the warning of first minister, the king's men set out to take the old wise crow to their fortress. 
train_hindifullfemale_04601| On the way, wise crow said, My lord, in my condition, I cannot be of any help to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04602| Why do you unnecessarily carry me to the fortress? I will jump into a fire and perish. 
train_hindifullfemale_04603| Please permit me to do that. 
train_hindifullfemale_04604| Sensing his internal thoughts, the first minister asked him why he would want to end up in fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_04605| Old crow said, It is for your cause I met this fate in the hands of Crow king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04606| The minister said, You are a cheat, good at spinning words. 
train_hindifullfemale_04607| You were really born as a crow and even if you are born as an owl in your next birth, you will still be a crow in nature. 
train_hindifullfemale_04608| Haven't you heard the story of the mouse? 
train_hindifullfemale_04609| Even when she was born as a girl in another birth, she chose to marry not a human being but another male mouse? 
train_hindifullfemale_04610| The minister and other king's men pressed him to tell them that story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04611| There was a hermitage belonging to the sage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04612| He went one morning to river Ganga to bathe. 
train_hindifullfemale_04613| As he was reciting stanzas in praise of the Sun, he saw a kite carrying a mouse in its claws. 
train_hindifullfemale_04614| At once, the sage aimed a stone at the kite. 
train_hindifullfemale_04615| Hit by the stone, the kite released its prey and the mouse at once ran to the sage asking him for protection. 
train_hindifullfemale_04616| The kite addressed Sage and said, sage, you have hit me with a stone, which is not proper. 
train_hindifullfemale_04617| Are you not afraid of God? Surrender that mouse to me or you will go to hell. 
train_hindifullfemale_04618| The sage said, You wretched bird, my duty is to save God's creations, to punish the wicked, to respect the good, to honour the teacher and worship the Gods. 
train_hindifullfemale_04619| Why do you preach all those irrelevant rules of conduct to me? 
train_hindifullfemale_04620| The kite delivered a big lecture to the sage on the right path. 
train_hindifullfemale_04621| You have no idea of what is good and what is bad. 
train_hindifullfemale_04622| God created all of us and at the time of creation also prescribed what should be our food. 
train_hindifullfemale_04623| God has marked mice, other rodents and insects to be food for us. 
train_hindifullfemale_04624| Why do you blame me for seeking what God has meant for me? 
train_hindifullfemale_04625| There is nothing wrong for anyone to eat the food marked for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04626| The danger comes when one eats what is not food for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04627| What is meat for someone is poison for someone else. 
train_hindifullfemale_04628| It is not proper for sages to be violent. 
train_hindifullfemale_04629| They are not presumed to notice what is happening around them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04630| They are detached from this world. 
train_hindifullfemale_04631| Nothing that happens in the material world should interest them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04632| They should not discriminate between vice and virtue. 
train_hindifullfemale_04633| They are above everything. 
train_hindifullfemale_04634| But by your deed today you have lost all the gains of your penance. 
train_hindifullfemale_04635| Learn from this story of three brothers how to attain that state of detachment. 
train_hindifullfemale_04636| Sage asked the kite to relate that story to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04637| The kite told him the following story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04638| Once upon a time, three sages, who were also brothers, chose a riverbank to do penance. 
train_hindifullfemale_04639| Their names were Ram, Sam and Sunil. 
train_hindifullfemale_04640| The clothes they washed every day used to dry in the sky without a clothesline lest they should drop and become soiled. 
train_hindifullfemale_04641| One day a kite was carrying a female frog, like I, the kite, carried a female mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04642| Ram saw this and shouted at the kite, Leave it, Leave it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04643| At once his clothes drying in the sky dropped down to the ground. 
train_hindifullfemale_04644| When Sam saw this, he shouted at the kite, Do not leave it, and soon his clothes also came down hurtling. 
train_hindifullfemale_04645| Sunil saw that the clothes of his elder brothers fell down. 
train_hindifullfemale_04646| He thought it would be better not to say anything and remained silent. 
train_hindifullfemale_04647| That is why it is better not to notice the happenings around and concentrate on self. 
train_hindifullfemale_04648| The sage replied, foolish kite, your story has happened in the age of truth when even if you spoke to a wicked person you became a sinner. 
train_hindifullfemale_04649| The clothes came down because the first two sages addressed the wicked kite. 
train_hindifullfemale_04650| We are now living in the age of kali, an age in which everyone is a born sinner. 
train_hindifullfemale_04651| In this age only those who commit a sin become sinners and not those who speak to sinners. 
train_hindifullfemale_04652| Now, do not waste my time, Disperse or face my curse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04653| The kite flew away disappointed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04654| The female mouse then prayed to the Sage, and pleaded to give her a shelter in his hermitage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04655| Otherwise, some wicked bird will kill me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04656| I will spend the rest of my life with whatever leftovers you choose to feed me with. 
train_hindifullfemale_04657| The female mouse's prayer moved the sage but he thought that if he took her home, people would laugh at him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04658| So, he turned the mouse into a beautiful girl and took her home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04659| What is this you have brought, asked the sage's wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04660| Where did you bring this girl from? 
train_hindifullfemale_04661| She is a female mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04662| She needed protection from wicked birds. 
train_hindifullfemale_04663| That is why I turned her into a girl and brought her home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04664| You will need to shower all care on her. 
train_hindifullfemale_04665| I will make her a mouse again, said the sage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04666| Please do not do that, pleaded his wife, You have saved her life and therefore you have become her father. 
train_hindifullfemale_04667| I do not have a child. 
train_hindifullfemale_04668| Since you are her father, she becomes my daughter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04669| The sage accepted her plea. 
train_hindifullfemale_04670| The girl grew into a beautiful woman and became an eligible bride. 
train_hindifullfemale_04671| Sage told his wife, The girl has come to the age of marriage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04672| It is not proper for her to remain in our house. 
train_hindifullfemale_04673| The learned have said, He who keeps an eligible bride in his house Forfeits a place in heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_04674| So do his ancestors, It's all right, Look for a boy, said his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04675| Sage immediately summoned the Sun and told him, This is my daughter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04676| If she is willing to marry you, get ready to marry her. 
train_hindifullfemale_04677| He then showed the Sun to his daughter and asked her if she would marry him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04678| She said that the Sun was very hot and she would prefer someone else. 
train_hindifullfemale_04679| The sage then summoned the God of Clouds, the God of Wind and the God of Mountains. 
train_hindifullfemale_04680| The girl rejected every one of them on one ground or the other. 
train_hindifullfemale_04681| Then the God of Mountains told the sage, The most suitable candidate for your daughter is a mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_04682| He is more powerful than I am. 
train_hindifullfemale_04683| The sage then turned her into a mouse and gave her away to a king of mice in marriage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04684| That's why, first minister resumed, I want you to know that a crow is a crow and cannot become an owl. 
train_hindifullfemale_04685| Yet, disregarding minister's warnings, the king's men took away old wise crow to their fortress not knowing that they were bringing ruin upon themselves and the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_04686| Old wise crow thought on the way to his destination, This elder minister alone advised the king to kill me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04687| Of all of the king's men he alone knows statecraft. 
train_hindifullfemale_04688| If they had heeded his word and killed me the king would have escaped disaster. 
train_hindifullfemale_04689| When old wise crow's procession arrived at the entrance of the fortress, king owl king ordered his men to accommodate him in a comfortable place of his choice. 
train_hindifullfemale_04690| But old wise crow had other ideas. 
train_hindifullfemale_04691| If he had to hatch a plan to kill the king, it was not possible within the fort because he and his movements would be constantly under watch. 
train_hindifullfemale_04692| That would alert his hosts. 
train_hindifullfemale_04693| So, he thought, it was better to be outside the fort. 
train_hindifullfemale_04694| He told the king, My lord, I am grateful for your generosity. 
train_hindifullfemale_04695| But I am a politician and belong to the enemy camp. 
train_hindifullfemale_04696| Yet I am your devotee and faithful servant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04697| It does not become of me to live inside the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_04698| I will stay at the entrance of the fort and every day sanctify my body with the dust of your feet. 
train_hindifullfemale_04699| The king of owls accepted his request and let him stay where he wanted to. 
train_hindifullfemale_04700| The king's men took extraordinary care of his needs and very soon old wise crow became as strong as a wrestler. 
train_hindifullfemale_04701| Seeing wise crow's new personality, first owl minister told the king and other ministers, I regard all of you as very unwise. 
train_hindifullfemale_04702| Haven't you heard the learned often repeating the words of the bird Sindhu? The bird used to say, First, I am a fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_04703| Then the hunter and then the king and his ministers. 
train_hindifullfemale_04704| How was that? asked the ministers and Raktaksha began telling them the story of sindhu. 
train_hindifullfemale_04705| Tale of the golden droppings. 
train_hindifullfemale_04706| On a big tree in the lap of a mountain lived a bird named sindhu. 
train_hindifullfemale_04707| His droppings used to turn into gold as soon as they hit the ground. 
train_hindifullfemale_04708| One day, a hunter came to the tree in search of prey and saw sindhu's droppings hit the ground and turn into gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_04709| The hunter, struck by wonder thought, I have been hunting birds and small animals since I was a boy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04710| I am now eighty years old. 
train_hindifullfemale_04711| I have never seen in my life this kind of miracle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04712| He decided to get the bird some how and set a noose for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04713| Not aware of the trap, the bird stayed on the branch merrily singing. 
train_hindifullfemale_04714| Soon, the noose tightened and the hunter caught the bird and pushed him into his cage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04715| The hunter took it home and considered, If the king comes to know of this wonder, he will certainly take the bird away from me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04716| Instead, I will go to the king and present the unique bird to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04717| The hunter took the bird the following day to the king and presented it to him with great reverence. 
train_hindifullfemale_04718| The king was extremely happy and told his men to keep the bird in safe custody and feed him with the best bird food. 
train_hindifullfemale_04719| But his minister was reluctant to accept the bird. 
train_hindifullfemale_04720| He said, king, There is no use in trusting the word of this hunter and accepting the bird. 
train_hindifullfemale_04721| Has anyone seen a bird dropping gold? 
train_hindifullfemale_04722| Therefore, I request you to release the bird from the cage. 
train_hindifullfemale_04723| The king ordered the bird to be set free. 
train_hindifullfemale_04724| As soon as the door of the cage opened, the bird perched himself on a nearby doorway and defecated. 
train_hindifullfemale_04725| The dropping immediately turned into gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_04726| Sindhu then recited that line about fools, First, I was a fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_04727| Then the hunter and then the king and his ministers. 
train_hindifullfemale_04728| The senior owl minister continued, That's why I tell you that we are all fools in sparing the life of this minister of the crows. 
train_hindifullfemale_04729| Despite minister's warnings, the owls continued to look after old wise crow with great devotion. 
train_hindifullfemale_04730| The crow minister became strong and powerful. 
train_hindifullfemale_04731| Giving up all hopes of reforming his king and ministers, the senior owl minister called his close colleagues. 
train_hindifullfemale_04732| He told them, Friends, our king and his men are beyond reform. 
train_hindifullfemale_04733| We have given whatever advice a minister has to give. 
train_hindifullfemale_04734| We shall now leave this dangerous place and pitch our tents elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_04735| The elders have said, He prospers who anticipates danger and escapes it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04736| He who does not destroy himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_04737| I have been living in this jungle for so long, I have become old. 
train_hindifullfemale_04738| Yet, in all my life I have never heard a cave speaking like a human being. 
train_hindifullfemale_04739| What, a cave speaking like a human being! Surprising. 
train_hindifullfemale_04740| We have never heard of it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04741| Please tell us all about it, asked his followers. 
train_hindifullfemale_04742| The minister then told them the following story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04743| Deep in the rain forest lived a lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_04744| One day, he was very hungry and looked for a prey in every nook and corner of the forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04745| There was no animal, big or small, as far as he could see. 
train_hindifullfemale_04746| As he was wandering in search of food he found a big cave and thought, There must be some animal living here. 
train_hindifullfemale_04747| If so, it is bound to return to the cave in the evening. 
train_hindifullfemale_04748| I will hide myself in the cave and when the animal returns, pounce on him and have a good meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_04749| Then as sun began to set, a jackal, came to the cave that was his home and saw the footprints of the lion entering the cave. 
train_hindifullfemale_04750| There were, however, no traces of footprints to show that the lion had left. 
train_hindifullfemale_04751| Scared, the jackal wanted to make sure that it was a lion or some big animal that went into the cave. 
train_hindifullfemale_04752| But how should he know? He hit upon a brilliant idea. 
train_hindifullfemale_04753| The jackal went near the cave and began shouting, Hello cave, I am your friend here. 
train_hindifullfemale_04754| There was no reply from the cave. 
train_hindifullfemale_04755| He did not know what to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_04756| He again shouted, Hello cave, do you not remember the arrangement we made? 
train_hindifullfemale_04757| I have to shout when I arrive at the cave and you will ask me to come in. 
train_hindifullfemale_04758| Without your green signal I do not enter the cave. 
train_hindifullfemale_04759| Since you are silent, I will go to some other cave. 
train_hindifullfemale_04760| The lion heard the jackal speaking and thought, Ah, there seems to be an arrangement between the cave and this animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_04761| Let me get him into my trap. 
train_hindifullfemale_04762| I will shout back a welcome to him and he will walk in happily. 
train_hindifullfemale_04763| The lion then roared, Hi jackal, come in, You are welcome. 
train_hindifullfemale_04764| The jackal at once knew it was a lion inside the cave and hurriedly fled the place. 
train_hindifullfemale_04765| When he fled he remembered the lines of the learned, He survives who anticipates a danger and acts to avert it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04766| He who does not comes to grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_04767| The old owl minister said, That is how we must also anticipate danger and act. 
train_hindifullfemale_04768| Let us leave now before it is too late. 
train_hindifullfemale_04769| Listening to his advice, his ministers and others followed him to a far off place. 
train_hindifullfemale_04770| Now the main obstacle in his way has disappeared and that the remaining king's men were all stupid. 
train_hindifullfemale_04771| Old wise crow began piling up twigs on the pretext of building a nest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04772| He heaped them at the entrance of the cave in which the king and other owls lived. 
train_hindifullfemale_04773| When the pile was big enough, he waited for daybreak when the owls would become blind. 
train_hindifullfemale_04774| Then he flew off to Crow king and told him everything before word could reach the enemy camp. 
train_hindifullfemale_04775| He and his followers should accompany him each carrying a piece of burning wood. 
train_hindifullfemale_04776| Accordingly, Crow king and his men followed old wise crow, each carrying a burning twig in his beak. 
train_hindifullfemale_04777| When they reached the entrance of the cave, which was now blocked by the pile of twigs old wise crow built, they threw the burning twigs on the pile. 
train_hindifullfemale_04778| The twigs began to burn fiercely killing all the owls trapped inside. 
train_hindifullfemale_04779| When Crow King and his men returned to their kingdom, he asked old wise crow to tell him how he could plan to kill the enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04780| Old wise crow said, It was not an easy job living in the enemy camp. 
train_hindifullfemale_04781| Luckily, except an old owl, every one of owl king's ministers was a fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_04782| Yet it was like walking on the edge of a sword. 
train_hindifullfemale_04783| But, if you want to achieve your goal, you will have to put up with all inconvenience and discomfort like the snake which carried the frogs, on his back. 
train_hindifullfemale_04784| The tale of frogs that rode a snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04785| A black snake lived in a forest on the Varuna hills. 
train_hindifullfemale_04786| He was becoming old and worried that he would not be able to snare frogs any more and that would make him weak and bring his end closer. 
train_hindifullfemale_04787| With a plan in his head, he went to a lake and resting on its edge pretended that he had lost all interest in worldly matters. 
train_hindifullfemale_04788| A frog in the lake came out and asked him, Uncle, why are you not preying for food as you used to do in the past? 
train_hindifullfemale_04789| The snake said, Listen, my son, I am very unfortunate. 
train_hindifullfemale_04790| How can I have any fervour for food? 
train_hindifullfemale_04791| Last night when I was on my rounds looking for food I sighted a frog. 
train_hindifullfemale_04792| When I tried to get at him, he jumped into the middle of a group of priests reciting the Vedas. 
train_hindifullfemale_04793| I could not track him, But soon I saw something like a frog near the priests and at once jumped at him and bit him. 
train_hindifullfemale_04794| It turned out to be the thumb of a Brahmin boy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04795| The boy died immediately, When his father found that I had killed his son, he cursed me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04796| You wicked snake, you have killed my innocent son. 
train_hindifullfemale_04797| From now onwards you will serve as a vehicle for all frogs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04798| Your life will be at their mercy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04799| I have now decided to serve my sentence. 
train_hindifullfemale_04800| That is why I am here, said the snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04801| The frog ran into the lake and told every one about the snake and his offer to serve as a vehicle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04802| Happy at the prospect, all the frogs went and met their king and told him about the snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04803| What a wonderful news, thought the king and trooped out of the lake with his ministers and subjects. 
train_hindifullfemale_04804| The king was the first to get on to the hood of the snake, followed by his ministers. 
train_hindifullfemale_04805| In the order of seniority and prominence, the king's subjects also climbed the back of the snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04806| Those unfortunate frogs that could not find space on the vehicle followed the snake in a procession. 
train_hindifullfemale_04807| To entertain them, the snake showed several feats he could do. 
train_hindifullfemale_04808| Thrilled by the experience of riding a deadly snake, the king of frogs thought that the ride had no parallel. 
train_hindifullfemale_04809| No ride, whether on an elephant or a horse or a chariot or a palanquin, can match this experience, he thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_04810| On the second day, snake slowed down the pace of his haul. 
train_hindifullfemale_04811| Noticing the change of pace, frog king asked the snake why he was not moving as briskly as he used to. 
train_hindifullfemale_04812| The snake told the king of frogs that he had no food that day and being weak he was not able to carry so much load. 
train_hindifullfemale_04813| Frog King, taking pity on the snake, said, You can have the younger frogs for your food. 
train_hindifullfemale_04814| Thrilled at this offer, the snake said, king of frogs, my plight is due to the curse the priest gave me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04815| Your magnanimous concession has released me today from the curse, I am so happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04816| The snake thus began eating a few frogs every day and soon became strong and healthy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04817| He was also worried that if he began eating the frogs at that rate there would not be any frogs left for him in the future. 
train_hindifullfemale_04818| Meanwhile, a big cobra chanced to come that way. 
train_hindifullfemale_04819| Seeing the snake carrying the frogs and struck by wonder asked the snake, This is very unique though unnatural. 
train_hindifullfemale_04820| How is it you have become a vehicle for frogs which are our natural food?. 
train_hindifullfemale_04821| That's a long story resembling the story of the Brahmin who pretended to have become blind after eating the good food his wife had made, said the black snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04822| The cobra asked the snake to relate that story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04823| Once upon a time, a Brahmin named Yagna lived in a city. 
train_hindifullfemale_04824| He had a wife who was not trustworthy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04825| She had a lover to whom she would secretly send every day delicious food she made. 
train_hindifullfemale_04826| One day, her husband found out what she was doing. 
train_hindifullfemale_04827| He asked her, My dear, you are making every day some special dish or the other and taking it out of the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_04828| Tell me, what is the truth. 
train_hindifullfemale_04829| With great presence of mind, she told yagna, Every day I am fasting and taking this food to offer to the Goddess. 
train_hindifullfemale_04830| To allay suspicion, she collected food and telling her husband that she was leaving for the temple, left home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04831| The husband began following her secretly and when she went to the tank to bathe, he went to the temple of the Goddess and hid behind the idol. 
train_hindifullfemale_04832| After taking bath in the tank, the Brahmin's wife came to the temple from the tank. 
train_hindifullfemale_04833| Then she began praying to the Goddess, Mother, tell me how can I render my husband blind? 
train_hindifullfemale_04834| The Brahmin, hiding behind the idol, changed his voice and said, great devotee, you feed your husband daily with good and delicious food. 
train_hindifullfemale_04835| Very soon he will become blind. 
train_hindifullfemale_04836| From then onwards, the wife began feeding her husband with delicacies. 
train_hindifullfemale_04837| Soon, the Brahmin complained to the wife that he was not able to see clearly. 
train_hindifullfemale_04838| The wife thought that the Goddess had at last fulfilled her desire. 
train_hindifullfemale_04839| Encouraged by the Brahmin's blindness, his wife's lover began visiting her without any fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_04840| One day, yagna saw him and his wife together. 
train_hindifullfemale_04841| The lover ignored him thinking the Brahmin was blind. 
train_hindifullfemale_04842| Yagna then thrashed the lover so hard that he died. 
train_hindifullfemale_04843| The Brahmin then cut the nose of his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04844| That's why, black snake told the cobra, I am pretending to be friendly with the frogs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04845| Frog King, the king of frogs overheard this conversation and asked black snake if what he had heard was true. 
train_hindifullfemale_04846| The snake at once realised his mistake and told the king of frogs that it was all fun. 
train_hindifullfemale_04847| The king of frogs foolishly believed the words of the snake and the snake slowly swallowed all the frogs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04848| Old wise crow told the crow king that he followed the tactics of black snake in misleading his enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_04849| Pleased, the king of crows said, What you have said is correct. 
train_hindifullfemale_04850| Great men do not give up what they have begun even in the face of obstacles. 
train_hindifullfemale_04851| Cowards, afraid of failure, do not venture at all. 
train_hindifullfemale_04852| There are some that begin a task and give it up when there is a problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_04853| But courageous people do not give up whatever dangers they face. 
train_hindifullfemale_04854| You have crushed the enemies and brought security to my kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_04855| The learned have said, It is dangerous to leave. 
train_hindifullfemale_04856| A fire unextinguished. 
train_hindifullfemale_04857| A debt unredeemed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04858| An enemy uncrushed and A disease untreated. 
train_hindifullfemale_04859| Old wise crow said, My lord, virtue belongs to him who is charitable, learned, courageous and friendly. 
train_hindifullfemale_04860| Virtue brings wealth, Wealth brings power. 
train_hindifullfemale_04861| It is a king with these qualities who can rule and expand his kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_04862| I have done my duty, I need rest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04863| But I humbly seek to offer one word of advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_04864| All this power should not go to your head. 
train_hindifullfemale_04865| Follow the path of duty and rule your subjects for a hundred years, May God bless you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04866| This is the end of the third strategy Vishnu Sharma disclosed to his royal wards. 
train_hindifullfemale_04867| The story of the potter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04868| Once upon a time, there lived in a village a potter named Dutta. 
train_hindifullfemale_04869| One day, he drank a lot of liquor and got intoxicated and began running. 
train_hindifullfemale_04870| He lost his balance and fell on broken pieces of a pitcher. 
train_hindifullfemale_04871| The sharp edges of the pot pieces cut a big and bloody gash in his forehead. 
train_hindifullfemale_04872| Somehow, he got up and went home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04873| The wound took a long time to heal because he neglected to follow the instructions of the doctor. 
train_hindifullfemale_04874| Suddenly, a famine struck the whole country. 
train_hindifullfemale_04875| The potter left the country with some others of the royal household. 
train_hindifullfemale_04876| In the new country, he found a job with the king of that country. 
train_hindifullfemale_04877| The king saw the mark of the big wound on his face and thought that Dutta must have been a great warrior who suffered wounds in a battle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04878| The king began showering special attention and affection on the potter, which the king's sons envied. 
train_hindifullfemale_04879| They could not harm him because he was the king's favourite. 
train_hindifullfemale_04880| When everything was going smoothly for the potter, a war came. 
train_hindifullfemale_04881| The king was summoning all known warriors to honour them and prepare them for the war. 
train_hindifullfemale_04882| The king's men were readying the elephants and horses for the combat while the soldiers were busy staging rehearsals. 
train_hindifullfemale_04883| It was now time for the king to know everything about Dutta 
train_hindifullfemale_04884| He sent for the potter and asked him when no one was around, What is your name, warrior? 
train_hindifullfemale_04885| In what battle were you injured? 
train_hindifullfemale_04886| The potter told the king, My lord, this is not a wound inflicted on me in a battle. 
train_hindifullfemale_04887| I am a potter and my name is Dutta, One day, when I was drunk, I ran and fell on sharp pieces of a broken pot. 
train_hindifullfemale_04888| This scar on my face is the result of that fall. 
train_hindifullfemale_04889| Ashamed that he deceived himself by the speech and garments of the potter, the king asked his servants to throw out the potter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04890| But Dutta appealed to the king, My lord, please do not throw me out. 
train_hindifullfemale_04891| See how well I will fight. 
train_hindifullfemale_04892| The king said, I admit you are a warrior. 
train_hindifullfemale_04893| But you are born in a potter community and hence cannot kill an elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04894| How is that, asked the potter. 
train_hindifullfemale_04895| The king then told him the following story. 
train_hindifullfemale_04896| A lion couple lived in a forest. 
train_hindifullfemale_04897| In course of time, the lioness delivered two lion cubs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04898| Every day, the lion went out and brought food for the lioness. 
train_hindifullfemale_04899| One day, the lion wandered all over the forest in search of food but could not find any prey at all. 
train_hindifullfemale_04900| At sunset, the lion gave up his search and was returning home when he found a jackal cub. 
train_hindifullfemale_04901| The lion took a fancy for him and took him home and gave him to his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04902| The lioness asked her husband, Did you get us any food today? 
train_hindifullfemale_04903| I found this cub, That's all, said the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_04904| I haven't killed him because he is a child, But if you are very hungry, you can have this child for your meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_04905| The lioness was angry and asked her husband, How can I kill him when you spared him his life? 
train_hindifullfemale_04906| The elders have said, Do not do an unworthy deed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04907| Even in the face of death; Do not give up a worthy deed. 
train_hindifullfemale_04908| Even if it means suicide, I will treat him like my third son, said the lioness. 
train_hindifullfemale_04909| Thereafter, the new jackal cub became one of the family and the three ate, drank, played and slept together. 
train_hindifullfemale_04910| One day when they were playing, an elephant passed by. 
train_hindifullfemale_04911| At once, the two lion cubs got ready to attack the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04912| The jackal cub told them that the elephant was an enemy of the lions and that it was better for them to leave. 
train_hindifullfemale_04913| But lion cubs didn't hear him and planned to attack elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04914| The jackal cub ran from that place fearing about the gigantic elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_04915| The lion cubs were disappointed at the action of their jackal brother. 
train_hindifullfemale_04916| They went home and told their father the details of how the jackal brother fled from the scene. 
train_hindifullfemale_04917| The father was not happy with his children and admonished them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04918| The lion took the jackal cub aside and told him not to discourage the lion cubs who, she said, were his younger brothers. 
train_hindifullfemale_04919| The jackal was hurt and asked his lion mother, How am I different from them in beauty or education or bravery? 
train_hindifullfemale_04920| Why should the two ridicule me? I will kill both of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_04921| Amused by the words of the jackal cub and wishing him long life, the lioness said, You are still a child. 
train_hindifullfemale_04922| I brought you up taking pity on you. 
train_hindifullfemale_04923| Your brothers are also young. 
train_hindifullfemale_04924| Before they grow old and know that you are different from them, leave this place and join your own folk. 
train_hindifullfemale_04925| Realising the danger ahead, the jackal cub left the lion family in search of his own folk. 
train_hindifullfemale_04926| That's why, before other warriors find out that you do not belong to the warrior caste, leave this place, the king advised Dutta. 
train_hindifullfemale_04927| The potter immediately left the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_04928| The tale of the bird with two heads. 
train_hindifullfemale_04929| A great bird lived on the banks of a lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_04930| He had two heads but a single body. 
train_hindifullfemale_04931| One day,as the bird was wandering on the bank of the lake, he found a fruit, which was delicious. 
train_hindifullfemale_04932| One of his heads mumbled, This fruit is so delicious. 
train_hindifullfemale_04933| I am sure the heavens have sent it for me, I am so lucky. 
train_hindifullfemale_04934| Hearing this, the second head said, brother, let me also taste the fruit you are praising so much. 
train_hindifullfemale_04935| The first head laughed and said, Both of us have the same stomach. 
train_hindifullfemale_04936| It makes no difference whether I eat it or you eat it. 
train_hindifullfemale_04937| I shall give it to our beloved, She will be very happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_04938| The bird thus gave the fruit to his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04939| The second head was disappointed at this action of the first head. 
train_hindifullfemale_04940| One day, the second head found a poisonous fruit and told the first head, You treacherous fellow. 
train_hindifullfemale_04941| For what you have done to me, I will eat this poisonous fruit and avenge your insult. 
train_hindifullfemale_04942| The second head said, You fool, if you eat that, both of us will die because we have the same body. 
train_hindifullfemale_04943| Ignoring his warning, the second head ate the poisonous fruit and both of them died. 
train_hindifullfemale_04944| The story of the weaver. 
train_hindifullfemale_04945| There was a Weaver in a southern city. 
train_hindifullfemale_04946| One day, when he was weaving clothes, the wooden frames necessary for weaving were totally damaged. 
train_hindifullfemale_04947| He went to the forest to bring wood to make new frames. 
train_hindifullfemale_04948| From the forest he drifted towards the seashore where he saw a gigantic tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04949| He thought that if he could cut wood from the tree it would stand him in good stead throughout his life. 
train_hindifullfemale_04950| As he started to cut the tree, a Yaksha living on that tree said, weaver, this tree is my home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04951| So I have to protect it, I am very comfortable here enjoying the cool breeze coming from the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_04952| Weaver said, Sir, If I do not cut the tree and take home its wood, my family will starve and die. 
train_hindifullfemale_04953| So, please go somewhere else, I have to cut this tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_04954| All right, if you do not cut the tree, I will give you a boon of your choice, said the Yaksha. 
train_hindifullfemale_04955| The weaver said, Sir, in that case, I will go home and consult my wife and friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_04956| You can give me the boon later. 
train_hindifullfemale_04957| The Yaksha agreed to it, and Weaver went home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04958| On his way he met his friend who was a barber. 
train_hindifullfemale_04959| He asked him, Friend, a Yaksha has given me a boon of my choice and gave me time to consult friends and my wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04960| What boon do you want me to ask him? 
train_hindifullfemale_04961| Ask him to give you a kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_04962| You will be the king and I will be your minister. 
train_hindifullfemale_04963| Both of us can enjoy life here and hereafter, said the barber. 
train_hindifullfemale_04964| True, But let me ask my wife also, said the Weaver. 
train_hindifullfemale_04965| The barber warned the weaver against consulting his wife and said quoting learned people, A wise man can give to his woman Fine clothes, pearls and diamonds, But never consult her on his affairs Because women have low wits. 
train_hindifullfemale_04966| And said that home that is run by women or children or tricksters will meet ruin in the end. 
train_hindifullfemale_04967| The weaver gently ignored the advice of the barber saying that he would nevertheless consult his wife and went home. 
train_hindifullfemale_04968| He told his wife the whole story of the Yaksha and the boon he had offered. 
train_hindifullfemale_04969| Weaver also told his wife that his friend, the barber, had advised him to ask for a kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_04970| His wife said, my lord, how intelligent is a barber? Never listen to his word. 
train_hindifullfemale_04971| No wise man would consult children or barbers or servants or beggars. 
train_hindifullfemale_04972| Also, Kingship has too many problems, Conspiracies take away your peace. 
train_hindifullfemale_04973| With the crown come not only thorns, But also sinister plots and treason. 
train_hindifullfemale_04974| It was for the sake of kingdom Lord Rama lived in the woods. 
train_hindifullfemale_04975| Pandava brothers fled into exile. 
train_hindifullfemale_04976| The Yadava dynasty disappeared. 
train_hindifullfemale_04977| Therefore, no wise man will invite kingship that leads to killing brothers, friends and relatives, said the weaver's wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_04978| The weaver replied, My dear, what you say is true, But you haven't told me what boon I should choose. 
train_hindifullfemale_04979| The wife said, Every day you are able to weave a single piece of cloth. 
train_hindifullfemale_04980| That's barely enough to meet our daily needs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04981| Therefore ask the Yaksha to give you another head and two more hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_04982| That helps you to weave two pieces of cloth every day instead of one. 
train_hindifullfemale_04983| The first piece will help us meet our daily needs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04984| The second one will help us meet special needs. 
train_hindifullfemale_04985| We can sail through life comfortably and happily. 
train_hindifullfemale_04986| The weaver was happy with the advice his wife gave and went to the Yaksha. 
train_hindifullfemale_04987| He prayed to him, Sir, you have kindly given me a choice, I request you to give me two more hands and an extra head. 
train_hindifullfemale_04988| At once, he had four hands and two heads. 
train_hindifullfemale_04989| Happily, he began his homeward journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_04990| On the way people saw him and mistaking him for some monster hammered him with sticks and stones. 
train_hindifullfemale_04991| The poor weaver died on the spot. 
train_hindifullfemale_04992| He who has no wits of his own Or does not heed advice of friends Perishes like the weaver. 
train_hindifullfemale_04993| When the devil of greed dances on their head, people will become objects of ridicule like me. 
train_hindifullfemale_04994| The elders have said, He who covets the impossible or builds castles in the air, comes to certain grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_04995| Long long ago there was a man called Tenaliraman . 
train_hindifullfemale_04996| He was minister to a great king called Krishna Deva Raya. 
train_hindifullfemale_04997| He was supposed to be very clever. 
train_hindifullfemale_04998| Once in that city there was lot of problems due to rats. 
train_hindifullfemale_04999| Rats were everywhere, They were eating all sorts of books, papers and grains. 
train_hindifullfemale_05000| They also used to make holes in wooden shelves. 
train_hindifullfemale_05001| Sometimes they even nibbled the ears of little children. 
train_hindifullfemale_05002| Everybody knows that cats Kill rats. 
train_hindifullfemale_05003| But there were so many rats in the city but very few cats. 
train_hindifullfemale_05004| So the king asked every house in the city to grow cats. 
train_hindifullfemale_05005| But cats need milk to drink, Most of the houses did not have cows. 
train_hindifullfemale_05006| So the king gave cows to every house and asked them to grow them too. 
train_hindifullfemale_05007| All people were happy and used to give cats lot of milk to drink. 
train_hindifullfemale_05008| Tenaliraman was a lazy man and liked to drink milk. 
train_hindifullfemale_05009| So the first day he boiled the milk and poured it in a pan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05010| He gave the piping hot milk to the cat. 
train_hindifullfemale_05011| The cat, which was hungry came and sipped the milk from the pan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05012| Since the milk was hot it burnt its mouth, The cat ran away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05013| The next day and the next Tenaliraman did the same thing. 
train_hindifullfemale_05014| After a few days he stopped giving milk to the cat and started drinking it himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05015| Tenaliraman's cat was lean and hungry and all other cats were stout and happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_05016| One day the king wanted to see all the cats given by him and give prize to the fat cat. 
train_hindifullfemale_05017| He was very angry with Tenaliraman for not growing his cat properly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05018| Then Tenaliraman told the king that he was not lucky since his cat did not drink any milk. 
train_hindifullfemale_05019| The king wanted to put Tenaliraman in Jail for telling a lie and wanted him to prove what he said. 
train_hindifullfemale_05020| Then Tenaliraman brought the pan of milk and his cat. 
train_hindifullfemale_05021| The cat on seeing the milk ran away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05022| It thought that it was being given again hot milk. 
train_hindifullfemale_05023| The king pitied Tenaliraman and let him away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05024| The clever Tenaliraman lived happily forever drinking lots and lots of milk. 
train_hindifullfemale_05025| Before getting a position in Rayar's court and heart Tenaliraman was very lazy and never did any work. 
train_hindifullfemale_05026| One day he met a sage who taught Raman a secret Mantra and asked him to chant it thousand times in front of goddess Kali. 
train_hindifullfemale_05027| That night after the whole household went to sleep, Raman crept out of his bed and made his way to the Kali temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05028| He chanted the mantra with great devotion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05029| To his surprise goddess Kali with all her thousand heads stood in front of him when he finished chanting. 
train_hindifullfemale_05030| When his eyes fell on the goddess he started to laugh, this infuriated the goddess who demanded him to explain himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05031| Raman begged her pardon and said that it was just that it suddenly occurred to him that when he has a cold it is difficult enough to wipe one running nose. 
train_hindifullfemale_05032| He said that he wondered what the goddess would do if she ever caught a cold since she had thousand heads. 
train_hindifullfemale_05033| The goddess couldn't help smiling at his reply and gave him a boon, by which he will always make others happy with his wit. 
train_hindifullfemale_05034| She also said that henceforth he will be called Vikatakavi. 
train_hindifullfemale_05035| Raman was not satisfied with this boon he argued that it would do him no good. 
train_hindifullfemale_05036| Then the goddess brought forth two bowls in her hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_05037| One golden bowl containing the milk of wisdom and one silver bowl which had curds and stood for wealth. 
train_hindifullfemale_05038| These she offered to Raman and asked him to choose any one bowl and drink from it to be blessed with that boon. 
train_hindifullfemale_05039| Raman tricked the goddess by quickly gulping down the contents of both the bowls. 
train_hindifullfemale_05040| Again begged the goddess for forgiveness and explained that one without the other would be of little use. 
train_hindifullfemale_05041| He argued that wealth without wisdom and wisdom without wealth would both bring unhappiness. 
train_hindifullfemale_05042| The goddess relented and blessed him again with both the boons but she also warned him that to be so blessed will make other's envious. 
train_hindifullfemale_05043| Therefore he would make lot of enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_05044| But he would also have the wisdom to get out of any unpleasant situation. 
train_hindifullfemale_05045| Since Raman hailed from the village Tenali he was called Tenaliraman and since he was blessed by goddess Kali, he was called Vikatakavi Tenaliraman. 
train_hindifullfemale_05046| King Manuneethi Cholan had hung a huge bell in front of his palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_05047| He announced that anyone seeking justice could ring the bell and their voice will be heard. 
train_hindifullfemale_05048| One day the young prince went around the city in his chariot. 
train_hindifullfemale_05049| People cheered him where ever he went and welcomed him by beating drums and with pipes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05050| A young calf terrified with the loud noises ran berserk and got itself crushed under the wheels of the prince's chariot. 
train_hindifullfemale_05051| The mother of the calf helplessly watched its little one die . 
train_hindifullfemale_05052| The cow walked to the palace gates and rang the huge bell demanding justice from the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_05053| The king came out and saw the cow. 
train_hindifullfemale_05054| He learnt from his courtiers the death of the young calf under the wheels of his son's chariot. 
train_hindifullfemale_05055| King Manuneethi Cholan kept his promise. 
train_hindifullfemale_05056| He ordered his son to be killed for his recklessness. 
train_hindifullfemale_05057| The prince was killed the same way the calf had died. 
train_hindifullfemale_05058| He was crushed under the wheels of the chariot. 
train_hindifullfemale_05059| The king went through the same pain the cow had as he witnessed his son die and thereby being just at all cost. 
train_hindifullfemale_05060| Long long ago, there lived a boy called Shravan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05061| He was the only son of a poor and blind couple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05062| Shravan loved his parents and his sense of duty towards them was very high. 
train_hindifullfemale_05063| He made it his life concern to take care of his blind parents. 
train_hindifullfemale_05064| He tried to fulfill their every wish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05065| One day his parents expressed their wish to go on a holy pilgrimage to Kasi. 
train_hindifullfemale_05066| It was a prevalent belief among hindus that a dip in the holy river Ganges would rid them of a life time of bad karma. 
train_hindifullfemale_05067| Shravan at once made arrangements to take them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05068| He seated them in two baskets slung from either end of a wooden pole. 
train_hindifullfemale_05069| He balanced the wooden pole upon his shoulders. 
train_hindifullfemale_05070| The holy city of Kasi was a long way off. 
train_hindifullfemale_05071| Shravan had to walk day and night for long hours. 
train_hindifullfemale_05072| One evening they reached a forest, Shravan's parents were very thirsty. 
train_hindifullfemale_05073| They asked their son to fetch them some water. 
train_hindifullfemale_05074| Shravan left the baskets under a tree and went to a small stream to get water. 
train_hindifullfemale_05075| At the same time in the forest, King Dasharatha, the king of Ayodhya, was with his hunting party. 
train_hindifullfemale_05076| King Dasharatha was celebrated for his fine marksmanship and could find his target just by hearing a merest whimper. 
train_hindifullfemale_05077| As Shravan was filling his pot, it made a strange gurgling noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_05078| King Dasharatha mistaking the noise for a wild beast, aimed at the sound and shot his arrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_05079| Only when the arrow hit the mark and Shravan let out a cry did king Dasharatha realize his mistake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05080| He reached the spot as fast as he could and was disheartened to see that his arrow had pierced a young human. 
train_hindifullfemale_05081| He tried to help Shravan but it was too late. 
train_hindifullfemale_05082| Shravan wished King Dasharatha to take the water to his parents and died. 
train_hindifullfemale_05083| King Dasharatha, very ashamed to face Shravan's parents went to them and offered the water and asked for their forgiveness for his terrible mistake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05084| Shravan's parents on learning that their sole caretaker and loving son was gone would have none of King Dasharatha's apology. 
train_hindifullfemale_05085| They cursed king Dasharatha to a similar fate as their's. 
train_hindifullfemale_05086| Shravan's father cursed that King Dasharatha would also die of grief from separation from his son. 
train_hindifullfemale_05087| Both Shravan's parents died of grief soon after. 
train_hindifullfemale_05088| After many years the curse of Shravan's parents came true. 
train_hindifullfemale_05089| King Dasharatha too died of grief after his son Lord Rama went into exile to the forests for fourteen years. 
train_hindifullfemale_05090| Tenaliraman was a clever and witty person. 
train_hindifullfemale_05091| He was the hearty friend of king Krishna Deva Rayar. 
train_hindifullfemale_05092| The King often turned to Tenaliraman to help him out of difficult situations or solve a difficult problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_05093| In Tenaliraman city, Hilsa fish, was a very popular dish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05094| Hilsa fish being available only once a year, never failed to grab everyone's attention and interest. 
train_hindifullfemale_05095| When it was Hilsa season, house wives exchanged recipes, shopkeepers discussed the latest price of Hilsa. 
train_hindifullfemale_05096| Fishermen talked about catching the biggest Hilsa of the season. 
train_hindifullfemale_05097| The King was surprised to see even his courtiers discussing Hilsa fish rather than more important state matters. 
train_hindifullfemale_05098| Finally, unable to bear this any more he decided to put an end to all this talk about the fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05099| He thought he would be at peace even if people would stop about it for a few minutes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05100| He announced an award of fifty gold coins to anyone who could bring to the palace a big Hilsa fish from the market. 
train_hindifullfemale_05101| The only condition being that while bringing the fish to the palace no passer by must talk about the fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05102| Even after a week not one succeeded in this challenge. 
train_hindifullfemale_05103| Simple as the task seemed many tried to attempt it but the look of Hilsa fish did not fail to excite remarks from onlookers. 
train_hindifullfemale_05104| After a week Tenaliraman decided to take the challenge. 
train_hindifullfemale_05105| He woke up one morning, shaved off half of his beard. 
train_hindifullfemale_05106| Put mud all over his face and hair, put on old clothes and wore his shirt backwards. 
train_hindifullfemale_05107| His wife when she looked at him demanded to know where he was going looking like a tramp. 
train_hindifullfemale_05108| Tenaliraman simply smiled and said he was going to the market to buy the biggest Hilsa fish available. 
train_hindifullfemale_05109| So saying he left her and headed to the market. 
train_hindifullfemale_05110| There he bought a big Hilsa fish, he started walking towards the palace making very little effort to hide the fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05111| On the way people who met him were shocked at Tenaliraman's appearance. 
train_hindifullfemale_05112| They wondered if he had finally gone mad. 
train_hindifullfemale_05113| With mud on his face and his beard half shaven he did look strange. 
train_hindifullfemale_05114| Some others feared that Tenaliraman had lost his memory. 
train_hindifullfemale_05115| When Tenaliraman reached the palace gates the guards hardly recognised him and would not let him inside. 
train_hindifullfemale_05116| One guard went inside to inform the king, and then the king summoned Tenaliraman inside. 
train_hindifullfemale_05117| He took one look at Tenaliraman and was shocked to see his best advisor looking like a tramp. 
train_hindifullfemale_05118| He demanded Tenaliraman to explain himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05119| Tenaliraman merely laughed and replied that he had won the challenge and the king owed him fifty gold coins. 
train_hindifullfemale_05120| The king looked confused he wanted to know what challenge was Tenaliraman talking about. 
train_hindifullfemale_05121| Tenaliraman unwrapped a big Hilsa fish from under his arms and showed it to the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_05122| No one who had met him had spoken anything about the fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05123| In fact no one had noticed the fish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05124| Tenaliraman's looks had taken away all their attention. 
train_hindifullfemale_05125| The king laughed at Tenaliraman's cleverness and gave Tenaliraman fifty gold coins. 
train_hindifullfemale_05126| He also suggested him to go home at once and clean himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05127| Tenaliraman went home happier and richer. 
train_hindifullfemale_05128| There was once a merchant who employed many carpenters and masons to build a temple in his garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_05129| Regularly, they would start work in the morning, and take a break for the mid-day meals, and return to resume work till evening. 
train_hindifullfemale_05130| One day, a group of monkeys arrived at the site of the building and watched the workers leaving for their mid-day meals. 
train_hindifullfemale_05131| One of the carpenters was sawing a huge log of wood. 
train_hindifullfemale_05132| Since it was only half-done he placed a wedge in between to prevent the log from closing up. 
train_hindifullfemale_05133| He then went off along with the other workers for his meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_05134| When all the workers were gone, the monkeys came down from the trees and started jumping around the site, and playing with the instruments. 
train_hindifullfemale_05135| There was one monkey, who got curious about the wedge placed between the log. 
train_hindifullfemale_05136| He sat down on the log, and having placed himself in between the half-split log, caught hold of the wedge and started pulling at it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05137| All of a sudden, the wedge came out. 
train_hindifullfemale_05138| As a result, the half-split log closed in and the monkey got caught in the gap of the log. 
train_hindifullfemale_05139| As was his destiny, he was severely wounded. 
train_hindifullfemale_05140| The wise indeed say, One, who interferes in other's work, surely comes to grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_05141| One day, a jackal called Gomaya was very hungry, and was wandering about in search of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05142| After some time, he wandered out of the jungle he lived in, and reached a deserted battlefield. 
train_hindifullfemale_05143| In this deserted battlefield, a battle was fought recently. 
train_hindifullfemale_05144| The fighting armies had left behind a drum, which was lying near a tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_05145| As strong winds blew, the branches of the tree got rubbed against the drum. 
train_hindifullfemale_05146| This made a strange noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_05147| When the jackal heard this sound, he got very frightened and thought of running away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05148| If I cannot flee from here before I am seen by the person making all this noise, I will be in trouble. 
train_hindifullfemale_05149| As he was about to run away, he had a second thought. 
train_hindifullfemale_05150| It is unwise to run away from something without knowing. 
train_hindifullfemale_05151| Instead, I must be careful in finding out the source of this noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_05152| He took the courage to creep forward cautiously. 
train_hindifullfemale_05153| When he saw the drum, he realized that it was only the wind that was causing all the noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_05154| He continued his search for food, and near the drum he found sufficient food and water. 
train_hindifullfemale_05155| The wise indeed say, Only the brave succeed in life. 
train_hindifullfemale_05156| In a city called Vardhamana, lived a very efficient and prosperous merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05157| The king was aware of his abilities, and therefore made him the administrator of the kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_05158| With his efficient and intelligent ways, he kept common man very happy, and at the same time he impressed the king on the other side. 
train_hindifullfemale_05159| Such a person, who can keep everybody happy, is rarely found. 
train_hindifullfemale_05160| Later, there came a time when the merchant's daughter was getting married. 
train_hindifullfemale_05161| He arranged for a lavish reception. 
train_hindifullfemale_05162| The merchant not only invited the king and the queen, who obliged by attending, but he also invited the entire royal household and all respected people of the kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_05163| During the reception, he ensured to provide his guests with the best of treatments. 
train_hindifullfemale_05164| He gave out gifts to guests to show them respect for attending to his invitation. 
train_hindifullfemale_05165| A servant of the royal household, who used to sweep the palace, was not invited but attended the reception. 
train_hindifullfemale_05166| He took a seat which was reserved for royal nobles, not meant for common invitees. 
train_hindifullfemale_05167| This made the merchant very angry. 
train_hindifullfemale_05168| He caught him by the neck and ordered his servants to have him thrown out. 
train_hindifullfemale_05169| The royal servant felt very insulted, and could not sleep all night. 
train_hindifullfemale_05170| He thought, If I can have the king to disfavour this merchant, I will have my revenge. 
train_hindifullfemale_05171| But what can I, a common fellow, do to harm a powerful person as him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05172| Thinking such, he suddenly had a plan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05173| Several days later, the servant was sweeping the floor near the king's bed early in the morning. 
train_hindifullfemale_05174| He observed that the king was still in bed, half awake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05175| The servant started mumbling, Good heavens! The merchant has become so carefree now that he dared to embrace the queen! 
train_hindifullfemale_05176| When the king heard this lying in his bed, he jumped up and asked the servant, Is it true? Have you seen the merchant embrace my queen yourself? 
train_hindifullfemale_05177| The servant at once fell at the king's feet, O Master, I was gambling all night. 
train_hindifullfemale_05178| I feel drowsy for I didn't sleep last night. 
train_hindifullfemale_05179| I don't know what I have been mumbling, but I said anything improper, please forgive me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05180| The king spoke no more, but the servant knew he had sowed the seed of distrust. 
train_hindifullfemale_05181| The king thought, It can be true! The servant moves about the palace freely, and so does the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05182| It is possible that the servant has seen something. 
train_hindifullfemale_05183| The king was troubled with jealousy. 
train_hindifullfemale_05184| From that day onwards, he withdrew his favours from the merchant and even forbade him to enter the palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_05185| One day, when the merchant was entering the gateway to the palace, he was stopped by the guards. 
train_hindifullfemale_05186| The merchant was surprised due to this sudden change in the king's attitude. 
train_hindifullfemale_05187| The servant was nearby, and mocking shouted at the guards, Ho Guards! That merchant is favoured by the king, He is a powerful person. 
train_hindifullfemale_05188| He can have people arrested or released or even thrown out, just like he had me thrown out of his daughter's reception. 
train_hindifullfemale_05189| Beware, for you may suffer the same fate. 
train_hindifullfemale_05190| On hearing this, the merchant understood that the servant had caused all this trouble somehow. 
train_hindifullfemale_05191| He felt dejected, and returned home upset over the incident. 
train_hindifullfemale_05192| He gave everything a second thought, and then he invited the royal servant to his house. 
train_hindifullfemale_05193| He treated the servant with utmost respect, and flattered him with gifts and garments. 
train_hindifullfemale_05194| He said kindly, O friend, that day I did not have you thrown out due to anger, but it was improper of you to occupy the seat reserved for the royal nobles. 
train_hindifullfemale_05195| They felt insulted, and out of compulsion I had to throw you out. Please forgive me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05196| The servant was already flattered with all the gifts, and he was full of joy, Sir, I forgive you. You have not only expressed your regrets, but also honoured me with utmost respect. 
train_hindifullfemale_05197| He ensured the merchant, I will prove you how clever I am. 
train_hindifullfemale_05198| I will have the king favourable towards you, like he was before. 
train_hindifullfemale_05199| The servant went back home. 
train_hindifullfemale_05200| Early next morning, when he started sweeping the floors of the palace, he waited till when the king was lying half-awake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05201| When the opportunity came, he started sweeping around his bed and started mumbling, Our king is crazy, he eats cucumber in the lavatory! 
train_hindifullfemale_05202| On hearing this, the king was taken aback. 
train_hindifullfemale_05203| He got up angrily and shouted at the servant, What nonsense do you talk about? Had you not been my royal servant, I would have punished you dearly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05204| Have you ever seen me doing such thing yourself? 
train_hindifullfemale_05205| Once again the servant fell on his knees and prayed, O Master, please forgive me if I said something improper. 
train_hindifullfemale_05206| The king thought to himself, I have never eaten a cucumber in the lavatory. 
train_hindifullfemale_05207| What he mumbled about me is ridiculously false. 
train_hindifullfemale_05208| Surely then, what he mumbled about my trusted merchant the other morning must have been ridiculously false too. 
train_hindifullfemale_05209| It was improper of me to mistreat the merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05210| He wondered, After all he has been so efficient in the whole administrative system, that without him it has become slack. 
train_hindifullfemale_05211| Thus, having considered carefully, the king invited the merchant to the palace and flattered him with gifts, jewels and garments. 
train_hindifullfemale_05212| He re-appointed the merchant to his previously held position, and favoured his services as before. 
train_hindifullfemale_05213| The wise indeed say, One should treat one and all, even the lowest, with respect. 
train_hindifullfemale_05214| Once upon a time, there was a sage called Deva Sharma who lived in a temple in the outskirts of a town. 
train_hindifullfemale_05215| He was widely known and respected. 
train_hindifullfemale_05216| People would visit him, and offer him with gifts, food, money and garments to seek his blessings. 
train_hindifullfemale_05217| The gifts that he did not need for himself, he would sell off, and got rich on the proceeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05218| And by nature, he trusted nobody. 
train_hindifullfemale_05219| So, he kept all his money in a bag which he carried under his arm all the time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05220| He would not part with the bag for a single moment. 
train_hindifullfemale_05221| One day, a swindler came across the sage, and he became sure that the bag this holy man was so possessive of, must surely contain a lot of treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_05222| He planned on stealing the bag from the sage, but could not think of a way to do so. 
train_hindifullfemale_05223| He thought, I cannot make a hole in the temple wall, or jump over the high gates. 
train_hindifullfemale_05224| But I can charm him with sweet words to accept me as his disciple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05225| He wondered, If I can stay with him as a disciple, I can win his confidence. When I get an opportunity, I will rob him, and leave this place. 
train_hindifullfemale_05226| Having planned so, the swindler approached the holy man with reverence, Om Namah Shivaya! I bow before Lord Shiva, the God of Destruction. 
train_hindifullfemale_05227| With these words, he fell on the sage's feet and said, O Guruji, Please guide me to the right path of life. 
train_hindifullfemale_05228| I am fed-up with life, and want to seek peace. 
train_hindifullfemale_05229| The sage kindly replied, My son, I will surely guide you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05230| You are blessed because you have come to me to seek peace at this young age. 
train_hindifullfemale_05231| This was the opportunity the swindler was seeking, and he at once touched the feet of the sage for blessings, O Guruji, please accept me as your disciple. I will do whatever you ask me to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_05232| The sage accepted the swindler as his disciple, but only on a condition. 
train_hindifullfemale_05233| He said, A holy man as me is recommended to spend the night alone without company. 
train_hindifullfemale_05234| This helps me to meditate also. 
train_hindifullfemale_05235| So, you will not be allowed to enter the temple at night. 
train_hindifullfemale_05236| You will sleep in a hut at the gate of the temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05237| The swindler agreed, I shall willingly serve your wishes in every way that you ask me to. 
train_hindifullfemale_05238| In the evening, the sage initiated the rituals and formally took the swindler as his disciple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05239| The swindler in return proved himself an obedient disciple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05240| He massaged his hands and feet, washed his feet and helped him with all the rituals along with cleaning the temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05241| Although the sage was happy with his disciple, the swindler could not gain enough confidence for the sage to part with his bag when he was around. 
train_hindifullfemale_05242| As days passed by, the swindler started getting frustrated, 
train_hindifullfemale_05243| He does not trust me enough to leave the bag with me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05244| I can gain access to the bag if I kill him with a knife or feed him with poison. 
train_hindifullfemale_05245| When he was thinking all this, the swindler saw a young boy visit the sage. 
train_hindifullfemale_05246| He was the son of one of the sage's followers. 
train_hindifullfemale_05247| He invited the sage, O Guruji, I have come here personally to invite you to our house for the ceremony of sacred thread. 
train_hindifullfemale_05248| Please accept the invitation to sanctify the ceremony with your kind presence. 
train_hindifullfemale_05249| The sage accepted the invitation, and after some time started off for the town with the swindler. 
train_hindifullfemale_05250| On the way, they came across a river, where the sage thought of relieving himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05251| He folded the bagful of money in his robe. 
train_hindifullfemale_05252| He asked his disciple to look after it, My child, Look after the robe until I return. 
train_hindifullfemale_05253| This was the opportunity that the swindler was seeking all the while. 
train_hindifullfemale_05254| As soon as the sage went behind the bushes, the swindler ran away with the bagful of money. 
train_hindifullfemale_05255| When the sage returned, he did not find the disciple around but found his robe lying on the ground. 
train_hindifullfemale_05256| Shocked and anxious, he peered inside only to find his bag of money was gone. 
train_hindifullfemale_05257| At once he knew what had happened, and began to shout, Oh! Where are you, you rascal. You have robbed me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05258| The sage then started trailing the swindler's footsteps, but he reached town. 
train_hindifullfemale_05259| He knew he will not be able to catch hold of him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05260| He stayed the night in town to return empty-handed to his temple next morning. 
train_hindifullfemale_05261| The wise indeed say, Do not be taken in by the sweet words of a swindler. 
train_hindifullfemale_05262| One day while a sage was going through a jungle, he saw two golden rams fighting each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_05263| Even though both were wounded, and blood was oozing out from their heads and bodies, they did not stop fighting and rammed at each other. 
train_hindifullfemale_05264| At the same time, a hungry jackal was passing by. 
train_hindifullfemale_05265| When he saw all the blood, he started licking the blood from the ground without caring for the fighting rams. 
train_hindifullfemale_05266| Watching all this, the sage thought to himself, This jackal is a fool as it has become greedy by the smell of blood. 
train_hindifullfemale_05267| If he comes between the fighting rams, it will get rammed and get hurt himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05268| No sooner had the sage thought of it, the jackal craving for more blood came nearer to the fighting rams, and got caught in the middle of their fight. 
train_hindifullfemale_05269| Both the rams rammed into him by mistake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05270| He got hit on his head, and fell down because he was severely wounded. 
train_hindifullfemale_05271| The wise indeed say, Do not close your eyes to the impending danger due to greed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05272| There was a big banyan tree, where two crows - husband and wife, had prepared a nice nest and made it their home. 
train_hindifullfemale_05273| In the hollow of the same tree, lived a black cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_05274| The crows had a problem because the black cobra would climb up the tree and eat the newborns, whenever the female crow hatched her eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_05275| They could do nothing to save them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05276| The crows went to a jackal, who lived in a nearby banyan tree, to seek his advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05277| They narrated everything to him and requested his advice for them to get rid of their problem. 
train_hindifullfemale_05278| They said, O Friend, It has become dangerous to live here. 
train_hindifullfemale_05279| Please tell us how we can protect our children from being eaten up by the wicked black cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_05280| The jackal replied, Please don't give up. Even powerful enemies can be overcome with the use of wit. 
train_hindifullfemale_05281| On hearing this, the crows requested, O Friend, please tell us how we can overcome and destroy this wicked cobra. 
train_hindifullfemale_05282| The jackal told them a plan, Fly into the capital of the kingdom, not far from here. 
train_hindifullfemale_05283| Visit the house of someone who is wealthy and careless at the same time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05284| Notice if something of value is lying around. 
train_hindifullfemale_05285| If you find so, pick it up when the servants are watching you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05286| He continued, You will need to fly slowly so that the servants can follow you. Return back to your tree and drop it in the hollow of the tree where the cobra lives. When the servants reach, they will kill the cobra when they see it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05287| The crows decided to follow the jackal's advice and flew off immediately according to his plan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05288| As they flew above the capital, the female crow noticed wealthy women swimming in a lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05289| They had left gold and pearl necklaces on the banks of the lake, which were guarded by royal servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_05290| At once the female crow swooped down, and picked up a big necklace in her beak, and started flying slowly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05291| When the royal servants noticed her, they picked up sticks and stones, and started throwing at her, and ran to chase her. 
train_hindifullfemale_05292| As planned, she dropped the necklace in front of the hollow of the tree, where the black cobra was asleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_05293| She sat on one of the branches for the royal servants to notice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05294| When the royal servants arrived, the black cobra came out of the hollow of the tree to see what all the noise was about. 
train_hindifullfemale_05295| The black cobra confronted the king's servants with swelling hood, but the servants attacked the cobra with sticks and stones to recover the necklace. 
train_hindifullfemale_05296| They killed the wicked cobra, and returned with the necklace. 
train_hindifullfemale_05297| And the crows, having gotten rid of the cobra, lived happily. 
train_hindifullfemale_05298| The wise indeed say, Even a very powerful enemy can be destroyed through deceit. 
train_hindifullfemale_05299| A heron lived near a big lake, which was full of fishes and other water creatures. 
train_hindifullfemale_05300| The heron had grown so old, that he could not catch fishes from the lake anymore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05301| He became lean and weak with every passing day due to lack of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05302| Unable to bear the hunger anymore, he hit upon a plan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05303| As planned, he sat at the edge of the lake for everybody to see, and began crying. 
train_hindifullfemale_05304| On seeing this, a crab took pity on him and went near, Uncle, What is the matter? Why are you crying instead of catching fishes? 
train_hindifullfemale_05305| Continuing to pretend, the heron replied, My child, I would not touch any fish anymore. I have decided to renounce all worldly matters, and vowed to undertake a fast unto death. 
train_hindifullfemale_05306| The crab asked, If you have indeed renounced worldly matters, why is it that you cry? 
train_hindifullfemale_05307| The heron explained, My child, I have been in this lake from my birth. I have grown here. 
train_hindifullfemale_05308| And now that I have grown so old that I hear that this lake will dry up as there will be no rains for the next twelve years. 
train_hindifullfemale_05309| The crab was surprised to hear this, Uncle, please tell me if it is true. Please tell me where you have heard such thing. 
train_hindifullfemale_05310| The heron replied, I have heard the news from a wise astrologer that there will be no rains for the next twelve years. 
train_hindifullfemale_05311| You see, there is already not much water in the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05312| And very soon, due to lack of rains, the lake will dry up completely very soon. 
train_hindifullfemale_05313| The crab was taken a back by the news of what is to be fall on them, and went to tell this to the other water creatures. 
train_hindifullfemale_05314| On hearing this piece of news, everybody started to panic. 
train_hindifullfemale_05315| They believed the heron, as he was not trying to catch any fish at all. 
train_hindifullfemale_05316| So, they met the heron to seek advice, Please guide us to save us from this disaster 
train_hindifullfemale_05317| The heron said, There is indeed a lake not far from here. It is full of water, and beautifully covered with lotus flowers. 
train_hindifullfemale_05318| There is so much water in the lake, that it would not dry even if it did not rain for twenty four years. 
train_hindifullfemale_05319| I can take you there, if you can ride on my back. 
train_hindifullfemale_05320| He had already gained their confidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_05321| So, they gathered around him and requested to carry them one at a time to the other lake and save them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05322| The wicked heron had succeeded in his plan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05323| Every day, he would carry one of them on his back, pretending to take them to the other lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05324| After flying a little away from the lake, he would smash them against a rock and eat them up. 
train_hindifullfemale_05325| He would then return after some time to the lake and repeat false messages how they are happy in the other lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05326| This happened for many days, when the crab said to the heron, Uncle, you take others to the lake but it is me who is your first friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_05327| Please take me to the other lake to save my life. 
train_hindifullfemale_05328| The heron was happy to hear this. He thought to himself, Having a fish everyday has become monotonous. It is good that I will get to eat a crab today, for a change. 
train_hindifullfemale_05329| Having thus decided, the heron started carrying the crab to the same rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_05330| The crab looked down from above and saw the heap of bones and skeletons. 
train_hindifullfemale_05331| At once, the crab understood what the heron was up to. 
train_hindifullfemale_05332| He remained calm, and said to the heron, Uncle, the lake seems far and I am quite heavy. 
train_hindifullfemale_05333| You must be getting tired, let us stop for some rest. 
train_hindifullfemale_05334| The heron was confident that there was no way the crab can escape from him in the sky. 
train_hindifullfemale_05335| The heron replied, there is no lake for real. 
train_hindifullfemale_05336| This trip is for my own meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_05337| As I do every day, I will smash you against a rock and make a meal out of you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05338| When the heron confessed the truth, the crab got hold of the heron's neck with its strong claws, and strangled him to death. 
train_hindifullfemale_05339| The crab laughed at himself that he had saved himself and the other water creatures from the trick played by the heron. 
train_hindifullfemale_05340| He dragged the heron back to the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05341| The other water creatures in the lake were surprised to see him back. 
train_hindifullfemale_05342| They became curious, and asked all sort of questions. 
train_hindifullfemale_05343| The crab laughed and replied, We were being made fools! The heron was an imposter and what he told you about the lake drying up was all false. 
train_hindifullfemale_05344| He was taking one of us every day for his meal in a rock not far from here. 
train_hindifullfemale_05345| He proudly said, I understood what he was up to, and have killed the trickster. 
train_hindifullfemale_05346| There is no need to worry, for we are safe in this lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05347| It is not going to dry up at all. 
train_hindifullfemale_05348| The wise indeed say, When things go wrong, use your wit to overcome the situation. 
train_hindifullfemale_05349| Mandavisarpini was a white flea. 
train_hindifullfemale_05350| She lived in the folds of the exquisite white silk sheet that covered the bed of a king in a certain country. 
train_hindifullfemale_05351| She fed on the king's blood without anybody noticing, and was happy to spend her days. 
train_hindifullfemale_05352| One day, a bug managed to enter the beautifully decorated bedroom of the king. 
train_hindifullfemale_05353| When the flea saw him, she warned, O Bug, what are you doing in the king's bedroom. Leave at once before you get caught! 
train_hindifullfemale_05354| The bug replied, Madam, even if I were a good-for-nothing bug, that is no way to treat a guest. 
train_hindifullfemale_05355| One should welcome a guest with humble words, sweet behaviour and offer refreshments. 
train_hindifullfemale_05356| The bug continued, I have fed myself with all types of blood, but never have I had the pleasure of the blood of a king. 
train_hindifullfemale_05357| It must be very sweet, for the king eats the choicest of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05358| I would love to taste the king's blood, if you permit. 
train_hindifullfemale_05359| The flea was taken aback, O Bug, you have a nasty bite, like a sharp needle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05360| Besides, I feed on the king's blood only when he is deep into his sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_05361| I can permit you to feed on the king's blood only if you promise to wait till he is asleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_05362| The bug agreed, I promise to wait till the king is asleep, and only after you have fed yourself, will I feed myself on his blood. 
train_hindifullfemale_05363| Soon after they decided on such terms, the king came to his bedroom and lay down to sleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_05364| The bug could not control himself, and decided to take a tiny bite of the king, without waiting. 
train_hindifullfemale_05365| As the king was yet to fall asleep, he jumped at the sharp bite of the bug. 
train_hindifullfemale_05366| The king shouted at his servants, Hey, there is something in my bed that has bitten me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05367| Look for it, as I have already been bitten. 
train_hindifullfemale_05368| On hearing this, the bug quickly hid himself in a corner of the bed, before the servants could start searching for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05369| However, the servants scrutinized the entire bed, sheet by sheet, and found the flea between the folds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05370| They killed her at once, and the king went to sleep without anymore worries. 
train_hindifullfemale_05371| The wise indeed say, the false promises of friends as well as strangers have no value. You end up paying for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05372| There was once a jungle that was ruled by a lion called Madotkata, who had a leopard, a jackal and a crow at his service, along with other animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_05373| As they did regularly, they were wandering about the jungle one day, when the lion saw a camel at a distance. 
train_hindifullfemale_05374| This camel had separated from its caravan and was feeding itself on the green grass of the jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05375| The lion took a fancy on this animal that he had not seen before, Let us go and ask this extraordinary animal, where he comes from. 
train_hindifullfemale_05376| The crow, who flies to far-off places was aware and replied, Master, it is called a camel and this animal lives in villages. 
train_hindifullfemale_05377| The flesh of this animal tastes good, let us kill it and eat it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05378| But the lion disagreed, He does not belong to the jungle, so he is our guest. I will not kill it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05379| Please go and assure him that no harm will be done, and bring him to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05380| As per the lion's instruction, they went to the camel and assured him that they were to bring it to the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05381| They won his confidence, and they brought the camel to the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05382| The camel stood before the lion and bowed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05383| He also narrated how he had gotten separated from his caravan and how he had reached the jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05384| On hearing this, the lion said, Oh Camel, if you return to the village you will be made a beast to carry burden again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05385| Stay in the jungle under my kingdom instead. 
train_hindifullfemale_05386| You can feast on the abundant green grass of the jungle without any fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_05387| The camel accepted the offer, and they began to live together in peace. 
train_hindifullfemale_05388| Later one day, the lion got severely wounded in a fight with a mad elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05389| Such were his injuries that he could not take a few steps, let alone go out for hunting. 
train_hindifullfemale_05390| Due to lack of food, the lion became weaker. 
train_hindifullfemale_05391| The animals who served him were also starving since they were dependent on the lion for their food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05392| When the lion could not bear anymore, he called them and said, Go and find any animal that I can prey upon even in my weak condition. 
train_hindifullfemale_05393| This way I can provide food for you, and also for myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05394| All the animals wandered about the jungle without any success to find such an animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_05395| On their way back, the jackal had a plan. 
train_hindifullfemale_05396| He said to the crow, there is no point wandering about the jungle when the food is right in front of us. 
train_hindifullfemale_05397| The camel can provide us with the food for all of us for a long time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05398| The crow replied, Indeed, what you say is correct. 
train_hindifullfemale_05399| But the master has assured the camel of his safety under his rule. He will refuse to kill him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05400| The jackal said, Leave that to me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05401| I will influence the master in a manner that he will agree to feast on the camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_05402| You wait till I return after a discussion with the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05403| The jackal met the lion and said, Master, we have been looking all around the jungle but could not find an animal for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05404| All of us have not had food for so long that we can hardly walk properly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05405| Under this circumstance, if you agree to kill the camel, his flesh can provide food for all of us. 
train_hindifullfemale_05406| The lion disagreed, Shame on you! How can I kill the camel when he has my assurance that his life will be safe under my kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_05407| It is a sin to think likewise. 
train_hindifullfemale_05408| But the jackal continued, Master, it would indeed be a sin to kill him after you have given him the assurance of his safety. 
train_hindifullfemale_05409| But if he offers himself as your food by himself, it would then not be a sin to kill him and accept his offer. 
train_hindifullfemale_05410| The jackal continued, What good are we, if we cannot be of our master's service in his time of need. 
train_hindifullfemale_05411| Please kill one of us for yourself, and the others to save the rest of us from dying of hunger. 
train_hindifullfemale_05412| The lion failed to justify the jackal and said, Please do what you think would be in the best for all of us. 
train_hindifullfemale_05413| After this, the jackal returned to the other animals and declared, Our master is sick and weak. 
train_hindifullfemale_05414| If something happened to him, there would not be anyone to protect us. 
train_hindifullfemale_05415| We have failed to get any animal after wandering throughout the jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05416| The only way now to repay our debts to the master would be to offer ourselves to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05417| This way the rest of us would be saved from dying of hunger too. 
train_hindifullfemale_05418| As planned, all of them stood before the lion and bowed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05419| They informed the lion that they did not succeed to find any animal for their food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05420| The crow said, Master, we could not find an appropriate animal for your food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05421| So, I offer myself. Please eat me to save yourself from hunger. 
train_hindifullfemale_05422| The jackal interrupted, You are too small to provide flesh for the master. 
train_hindifullfemale_05423| Even if he agrees your offer, it will not be enough for his survival. 
train_hindifullfemale_05424| Indeed, you have proven your devotion and by offering yourself, you have already freed yourself from the debts of the master. 
train_hindifullfemale_05425| He turned to the lion and said, Please accept my offer instead. 
train_hindifullfemale_05426| The jackal stood humbly before the lion, Master, please eat me to save yourself from hunger. 
train_hindifullfemale_05427| If you accept my sacrifice, I will be honoured with a place in heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_05428| On hearing this, the lion shook his head in refusal. 
train_hindifullfemale_05429| This way, the other animals started offering themselves, but the lion kept refusing to accept their offer. 
train_hindifullfemale_05430| The camel who was observing all this thought, All of them speak beautifully about offering themselves, but the master refuses to kill any of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05431| I shall seek to impress the master in a similar fashion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05432| Thinking such, the camel said to the other animals, You have offered yourself, but the master cannot eat you because all of you are carnivores and belong to the same category as the lion himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05433| Stand by, for I shall offer myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_05434| With this, the camel came forward and bowed before the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05435| He said, Master, you need not kill any of these animals. Please eat me instead. 
train_hindifullfemale_05436| I offer myself in return to your debts. 
train_hindifullfemale_05437| I shall find my way to the heaven, if you may please accept my offer. 
train_hindifullfemale_05438| No sooner had he made the offer, the other animals cheered. 
train_hindifullfemale_05439| Having already been influenced by the jackal, the lion jumped on him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05440| He was killed, and eaten by all the animals together. 
train_hindifullfemale_05441| The wise indeed say, Always be on guard when you are in the company of wicked people. Do not be taken in by their sweet words. 
train_hindifullfemale_05442| A pair of Tittibha birds, husband and wife lived on seashore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05443| The female Tittibha bird was expecting to lay eggs and raise a family. 
train_hindifullfemale_05444| When the time to lay eggs came, she asked her husband to look for a safe place to lay her eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_05445| My dear, please look for some good and safe place for me to lay eggs as it is almost time for me to lay them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05446| But the male Tittibha bird said, Dearest, where in the world could be a better place than this seashore? Please lay your eggs here. 
train_hindifullfemale_05447| She disagreed, the waves of the sea on full moon nights conquer the sea. Please call for your friends to help you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05448| No, please find a place away from here. 
train_hindifullfemale_05449| The male Tittibha bird laughed and insisted, The Sea would not even dare to do any harm to my children! Do not fear unnecessarily and lay eggs here without any worries. 
train_hindifullfemale_05450| All the time, the Sea had been hearing this, and thought, From a small bird as he, such impudence is not expected. 
train_hindifullfemale_05451| I'll certainly take away his eggs to see what he does after that and teach him a lesson. 
train_hindifullfemale_05452| Within a few days, the female Tittibha bird laid her eggs in the seashore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05453| Shortly afterward, when the birds went away in search of food, the Sea started making waves. 
train_hindifullfemale_05454| The waves became higher and higher, till it swallowed the eggs into it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05455| The birds returned later to find the nest empty. 
train_hindifullfemale_05456| The female Tittibha bird started weeping bitterly, See for yourself that the waves of the sea has swallowed our eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_05457| You are a fool not to listen to me when I asked you to find a safe place to lay eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_05458| The male Tittibha bird continued its stupidity, Dear, don't you worry. I will prove to you how brilliant I am. 
train_hindifullfemale_05459| I will dry the sea, and force it to return our eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_05460| The female Tittibha bird wondered, How can you dry this enormous sea? 
train_hindifullfemale_05461| The male Tittibha bird explained, Even small beings can overcome the strongest opponents if they are zealous. 
train_hindifullfemale_05462| And so, I plan to dry up the whole sea by sucking its water with my beak. 
train_hindifullfemale_05463| The wife argued, How can you suck the sea dry, when rivers like the Ganges and Indus, and hundreds of other rivers flow into it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05464| There is no good in this babbling. 
train_hindifullfemale_05465| While the husband argued, I'll work day and night to suck all the water from the sea with my beak, which is as solid as iron. 
train_hindifullfemale_05466| Man can succeed only after putting efforts. 
train_hindifullfemale_05467| The female Tittibha bird understood that she will not be able to convince him, 
train_hindifullfemale_05468| Dear, there is no point in arguing. If you want to conquer the sea, please call for your friends to help you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05469| The husband agreed, All right, I will do this with the help of my friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_05470| Now, all the friends of the male Tittibha bird were called and when they all gathered together, the male Tittibha bird explained his problem with the sea, and how it had insulted him, and how he plans to dry the sea to seek revenge. 
train_hindifullfemale_05471| All the birds, the swan, crane, peacock and other unanimously agreed that the task was impossible. 
train_hindifullfemale_05472| It is impossible for us to suck the sea to dry it up completely. 
train_hindifullfemale_05473| Instead, let us visit our king, Garuda. 
train_hindifullfemale_05474| When he comes to know that we have been harassed by the sea, he will get angry and seek revenge. 
train_hindifullfemale_05475| Even if we merely pay him a visit to seek his advice, we shall feel relieved. 
train_hindifullfemale_05476| As decided, they all went to their king, Garuda, and explained the reason of them being so sad. 
train_hindifullfemale_05477| O King, the sea has robbed the eggs of the good Tittibha birds even after the fact that you are our protector. 
train_hindifullfemale_05478| If this is allowed to continue, our entire race shall perish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05479| Garuda realized that the birds were in grave circumstances, and agreed to go and dry the entire sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_05480| Just as he was leaving, a messenger arrived from Lord Vishnu who needed his assistance at once, for some divine task. 
train_hindifullfemale_05481| Garuda explained to the messenger that he was unable to serve his master at this time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05482| I am such a common servant to the Lord for him to need me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05483| The sea, which is the resting place of the Lord, has swallowed the eggs of the Tittibha birds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05484| I refuse to serve him if he will not force the sea to return the eggs at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_05485| This is my firm resolution. Please let him know of it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05486| When Lord Vishnu came to know of Garuda's resolution from his messenger, he thought, I can understand his behaviour and need to pacify him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05487| He is the king and protector of all the birds. I must meet Garuda at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_05488| As Lord Vishnu visited Garuda, he bowed in respect and explained, O Master, the sea, which is your resting place has insulted me by swallowing the eggs of my humble servant, the good Tittibha birds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05489| It is out of the respect that I have for you that I have not taken any step for revenge. 
train_hindifullfemale_05490| Lord Vishnu considered his plea, Come with me Garuda. 
train_hindifullfemale_05491| You are right. The sea should not have done such a thing on purpose. 
train_hindifullfemale_05492| Let us go and return the eggs to the Tittibha birds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05493| After that we will leave, as I need your assistance. 
train_hindifullfemale_05494| They all went to the seashore where Lord Vishnu reprimanded the sea. 
train_hindifullfemale_05495| Taking a thunderbolt in his hand, he warned, O Sea, you have been wicked. 
train_hindifullfemale_05496| Return the eggs of the Tittibha birds at once or dare to face my anger. 
train_hindifullfemale_05497| When the sea heard the warning from Lord Vishnu himself, it was terrified. 
train_hindifullfemale_05498| It apologised at once, and returned the eggs to the Tittibha birds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05499| The wise indeed say, Do not underestimate the power of the timid. 
train_hindifullfemale_05500| There lived a turtle called Kambugriva in a lake, who had two swans as her good friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_05501| All three of them would meet on the banks of the lake every day, and exchanged stories, before returning at sunset. 
train_hindifullfemale_05502| One year, there was no rain and the lake started to dry. 
train_hindifullfemale_05503| The swans got worried about the declining water level of the lake, and said to the turtle, You will not be able to survive in this lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05504| All the water in the lake will soon dry up. 
train_hindifullfemale_05505| The turtle was aware of the problem, It is indeed difficult to live here anymore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05506| Dear friends, please look for an alternate lake which is full of water. 
train_hindifullfemale_05507| Then, find a strong stick from somewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_05508| The turtle continued, Once you find another lake, you can carry me to the lake with a stick. 
train_hindifullfemale_05509| I can hold the stick tightly with my mouth, while both of you can hold the stick at either ends and fly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05510| As planned, the swans flew to distant places and after some time found a lake which had plenty of water in it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05511| They returned to carry the turtle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05512| They prepared to hold the stick from both the ends, and suggested the turtle, Dear friend, everything seems fine. 
train_hindifullfemale_05513| But make sure to keep your mouth tightly shut all the time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05514| You must not speak, or you will fall off. 
train_hindifullfemale_05515| Finally, they started flying. 
train_hindifullfemale_05516| After some time, they had flown some distance when the turtle saw a town below. 
train_hindifullfemale_05517| The people of the town were staring at the sight of two swans carrying a turtle in the sky. 
train_hindifullfemale_05518| Look at that! This is a rare sight that two birds are carrying a turtle with the help of a stick, they shouted in admiration. 
train_hindifullfemale_05519| On hearing all the commotion, the turtle opened her mouth, What is all the commotion about?, she asked. 
train_hindifullfemale_05520| Needless to say, she went down the moment she opened her mouth, and the swans could do nothing to stop her from falling down to the earth. 
train_hindifullfemale_05521| As she fell down, the people of the town captured her to make a feast out of her. 
train_hindifullfemale_05522| The wise indeed say, Never fail to listen to the advice of your friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_05523| A couple of sparrows lived happily in their nest on top of a huge tree in a jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05524| The female sparrow had laid her eggs in the nest and they were expecting their newborns soon. 
train_hindifullfemale_05525| On a particular day, unable to bear the heat of the summer sun, an elephant went berserk. 
train_hindifullfemale_05526| He crashed into all trees in his way. 
train_hindifullfemale_05527| On his way, he broke the branches of the tree that supported the nest of the sparrow couple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05528| Although the sparrows managed to escape by flying away, they were heart-broken to see that they had lost the eggs. 
train_hindifullfemale_05529| The female sparrow began to cry and wail loudly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05530| A woodpecker, who was at a little distance, was touched by cries. 
train_hindifullfemale_05531| He went to her and said, Dear good sparrow! There is nothing you can do by crying. 
train_hindifullfemale_05532| What is destined to happen, will happen for sure. 
train_hindifullfemale_05533| The female sparrow replied, that is indeed true. 
train_hindifullfemale_05534| But all my children were killed by this wicked elephant, this is also true. We had done no harm to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05535| If you consider yourself to be a friend, continued the female sparrow, Please suggest me a way to destroy this elephant and avenge the death of my children. 
train_hindifullfemale_05536| So I will, replied the woodpecker, I have a fly as a friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_05537| Let us go and ask for her help to destroy this cruel elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05538| Thus, the woodpecker and the female sparrow went to meet the fly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05539| The woodpecker explained, My friend, please meet this sparrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_05540| She is a dear friend of mine. 
train_hindifullfemale_05541| Her eggs were destroyed by a wicked elephant; please help us find a way to destroy this cruel elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05542| I will certainly help you, the fly said after hearing the events, How can I be your friend, and yet not help you when you need me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05543| I have a frog as a good friend, let us seek his help to destroy this wicked elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05544| Thus, the female sparrow, woodpecker and the fly went to the frog, and explained him of all the events for which they had come to him for help. 
train_hindifullfemale_05545| The old frog said after hearing everything, The elephant is big, but he is alone. 
train_hindifullfemale_05546| What can this elephant do, if we work together to destroy him? I have a plan! 
train_hindifullfemale_05547| He explained, fly When the sun is scorching, your task would be to buzz in his ears. 
train_hindifullfemale_05548| When he closes his eyes in sheer ecstasy, the woodpecker's task would be to peck his eyes and make him blind. 
train_hindifullfemale_05549| In this scorching summer, he will certainly search for water, but being blinded already he will not be able to do so. 
train_hindifullfemale_05550| I will then sit on the edge of the nearby pit and croak at the top of my voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05551| He continued, When the thirsty elephant hears me, he will think there is a pond or lake nearby and follow my voice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05552| And when he does so, he will fall into the pit and perish. 
train_hindifullfemale_05553| This way, we can avenge the death of the sparrow's children! 
train_hindifullfemale_05554| The others agreed to the plan, and organized to do their part of the tasks as laid by the old frog. 
train_hindifullfemale_05555| They executed their tasks successfully, and the elephant fell into a muddy pit and was severely wounded. 
train_hindifullfemale_05556| The wise indeed say, Even the low and humble achieve results when they work together. 
train_hindifullfemale_05557| There lived a lion called Vajradaunstra in the jungle, who had two attendants, a jackal and a wolf. 
train_hindifullfemale_05558| One day a caravan was passing by, and one of the camels in the caravan was an expectant female. 
train_hindifullfemale_05559| As she was not able to walk, and was in labour pains, the caravan set her free and left her behind. 
train_hindifullfemale_05560| Within moments, she fell prey to the lion, and while the three of them were eating. 
train_hindifullfemale_05561| They cut the womb of the camel, from which a baby camel came out. 
train_hindifullfemale_05562| Since, it was just a baby, and they already had a good meal out of the camel, the lion decided to spare the baby camel's life. 
train_hindifullfemale_05563| He brought the baby camel home. 
train_hindifullfemale_05564| The lion said to the little camel, From now onwards you will live with us, and will have nothing to fear from, even me. 
train_hindifullfemale_05565| I will let everybody know that you are under my protection, and you can wander about fearlessly and feed on the green grass of the jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05566| From then onwards, they lived happily. 
train_hindifullfemale_05567| The four of them would tell each other stories, and the camel was always found along with the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05568| One day, the lion returned home badly injured after a fight with a wild elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05569| He was unable to even walk, let alone go out and hunt. 
train_hindifullfemale_05570| Unable to bear the hunger, he asked the camel, jackal and the wolf to go in search of some small animal that he will be able to kill, even in his condition. 
train_hindifullfemale_05571| Thus, the hunger for all three of them would be satisfied. 
train_hindifullfemale_05572| But the three of them returned empty-handed in the evening, even after their efforts to search for an animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_05573| The jackal began wondering in hunger, The young camel does not belong amongst us, and he will be able to provide food for many days. 
train_hindifullfemale_05574| But, I have to be cunning to convince the lion to kill him, as he has promised not to harm him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05575| He said to the camel, Our master will soon die of hunger, and so will we. 
train_hindifullfemale_05576| I and the wolf will die of starvation, and some other animal will prey on you after they know that there is nobody to protect you anymore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05577| I suggest you must offer yourself to the lion, and save us from dying. 
train_hindifullfemale_05578| For your sacrifice, you will be reborn in a body twice the size of what you have in this life! 
train_hindifullfemale_05579| The young camel agreed immediately, Had it not been for the lion, I would have been dead long ago. 
train_hindifullfemale_05580| I shall be rewarded hundred-times for my sacrifice, and find a place in heaven. I agree to offer my body. 
train_hindifullfemale_05581| In the evening, the jackal said to the lion, that the camel will be blessed with twice the size of the body in his next birth, if he killed him and worshipped God before eating him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05582| He explained that the camel was willing to offer his body for his sacrifice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05583| The lion was convinced by the cunning jackal and he agreed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05584| As soon the jackal was able to convince him, he jumped on the young camel and tore him apart. The young camel died instantly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05585| The lion remembered that he must worship before eating for the young camel's next life and asked the jackal and wolf to guard over the carcass, while he returned. 
train_hindifullfemale_05586| He then went for a bath and worshiped the gods. 
train_hindifullfemale_05587| When the lion was gone, the jackal thought, How can I fool the lion and have the entire camel for myself? 
train_hindifullfemale_05588| He thought of a plan, and called out to the wolf, Hey wolf! You know you are unable to tolerate the hunger anymore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05589| Eat a mouthful of the camel's flesh and I will convince the lion by making up a story. 
train_hindifullfemale_05590| The wolf started eating some, believing the jackal's words. 
train_hindifullfemale_05591| Just then the jackal alerted, here comes the lion, stop eating now! 
train_hindifullfemale_05592| When the lion returned, the wolf had stopped eating. 
train_hindifullfemale_05593| But the lion noticed that his food had been contaminated. 
train_hindifullfemale_05594| He roared in anger, How is it that my food is contaminated despite it being guarded by the two of you? 
train_hindifullfemale_05595| The jackal smiled at the wolf, I advised you not to eat, but you would not listen. 
train_hindifullfemale_05596| You could not tolerate your hunger and wait for the king's return! You should be ashamed of yourself! 
train_hindifullfemale_05597| The lion noticed the blood on the wolf's paw, and attacked it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05598| The wolf, realizing that he would die if he did not flee, ran for his life to never return again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05599| At the very moment a very big caravan approached. The camels in the caravan had large bells around their necks, and the jingling sound could be heard from a distance. 
train_hindifullfemale_05600| The lion was surprised by the unusual and terrifying noise and wanted to know what made the noise. 
train_hindifullfemale_05601| At once, the jackal used it as an opportunity. He said, O Master, it is the same caravan returning. 
train_hindifullfemale_05602| Only this time, it is led by Yama. 
train_hindifullfemale_05603| He must be very angry on you for killing the camel before the hour appointed for his death. 
train_hindifullfemale_05604| Look, he even brings the camels forefathers and relatives to avenge his death. 
train_hindifullfemale_05605| I suggest you should run away from here. 
train_hindifullfemale_05606| The lion believed him and was frightened. 
train_hindifullfemale_05607| When he saw the caravan approaching, with so many camels, he ran for his life. 
train_hindifullfemale_05608| When the jackal had finally gotten rid of the lion, he ate the camel's flesh all by himself. It lasted many days. 
train_hindifullfemale_05609| The wise indeed say, Spurn the company of the wicked; else you will come to grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_05610| There lived a group of monkeys in the mountains. 
train_hindifullfemale_05611| During one winter, there were heavy rains. 
train_hindifullfemale_05612| Drenched in the rain, they began to shiver in the cold. 
train_hindifullfemale_05613| During this time, some of the monkey found some colourful Gunja fruits, which appeared to them as embers of fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_05614| Hoping to make some fire for themselves, they began to blow at them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05615| A bird on a nearby tree was watching the monkeys from above. 
train_hindifullfemale_05616| Considering the vain attempts the monkeys were busy with, it thought of advising them against it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05617| What big fools you are. You are blowing at some Gunja fruits and not embers of fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_05618| You will never be able to make any fire out of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05619| What you are doing is a waste of time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05620| These fruits will not help you to protect yourself against the cold. 
train_hindifullfemale_05621| Go and find some shelter instead. 
train_hindifullfemale_05622| You may find a cave or a burrow where you will be protected from the rains and the cold winds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05623| The monkeys did not like his advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05624| One of the old monkeys said, Go fool yourself. Why are you interfering in our task? 
train_hindifullfemale_05625| But the bird disagreed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05626| Not heeding what the old monkey had said, it flew down from the tree and persisted that the monkeys stop what they were doing. 
train_hindifullfemale_05627| The monkey ignored his chatter but the bird refused to stop. 
train_hindifullfemale_05628| In an effort to convince the monkeys, the bird came close to explain that their efforts were useless. 
train_hindifullfemale_05629| Already frustrated by their vain efforts, the monkeys became furious. 
train_hindifullfemale_05630| One of the monkeys caught hold of the bird and smashed him against the ground. The bird was severely wounded. 
train_hindifullfemale_05631| The wise indeed say, Never give advice unless you are asked for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05632| A couple of sparrows lived on the branches of a huge tree, deep in the jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05633| They had worked very hard in building their nest, and it was a comfortable home that protected them in all weathers. 
train_hindifullfemale_05634| One day, during the winter, as they were enjoying the comforts of their nest, it started raining outside. 
train_hindifullfemale_05635| Sometime later, a monkey came to take shelter under the very same tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_05636| The monkey was all drenched in the rain, and his teeth were chattering in the cold. 
train_hindifullfemale_05637| When the female sparrow saw this, she felt pity on him and said from her nest, O Monkey, You have hands and feet similar to humans. 
train_hindifullfemale_05638| You can use them for many reasons. Why don't you make yourself a protected home? 
train_hindifullfemale_05639| The monkey was already suffering from the rain and the cold, and was in no mood for an advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05640| He replied, You wicked sparrow! Why can't you keep your mouth shut? 
train_hindifullfemale_05641| But the female sparrow continued her advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05642| She explained how she was able to enjoy the comforts of her home, and how she did not suffer from either heat, or cold, or rain. 
train_hindifullfemale_05643| This made the monkey very angry. 
train_hindifullfemale_05644| The monkey thought, What a wicked female bird! 
train_hindifullfemale_05645| She talks as if she has mastered all sciences and philosophies, and simply won't stop chirping. 
train_hindifullfemale_05646| She is making me so angry, that I might as well kill her. 
train_hindifullfemale_05647| I am already suffering from this rain and cold, I do not wish to hear any advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05648| The female sparrow, however, continued chattering and did not cease to advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05649| At one moment, the monkey became so angry, that he climbed up the tree and tore up her nest to pieces. 
train_hindifullfemale_05650| The wise indeed say, Give your advice only to those who deserve it, else you will come to grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_05651| There was a huge Banyan tree beside a lake, which nested a number of cranes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05652| In the hollow at the foot of the tree lived a poisonous black snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05653| He used to climb up and eat the crane's youngs after they were hatched. 
train_hindifullfemale_05654| One crane, who had lost her children to the cunning black snake, started weeping on the banks of the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05655| A crab, who was nearby, heard the crane weeping, and asked, Why do you cry, aunty? 
train_hindifullfemale_05656| The crane replied, I am the unlucky mother, all of whose children have been eaten by the wicked black snake, who lives in the hollow of the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_05657| What else can I do but weep? I would have killed the snake if I could! 
train_hindifullfemale_05658| The crab thought for a while, I have to devise a plan to have the black snake killed, and have the cranes destroyed at the same time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05659| The cranes are our natural enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_05660| I will tell him half truth and half lies, to my advantage. 
train_hindifullfemale_05661| Thinking so, the crab said to the crane, Aunty! I will tell you a plan to get rid of the black snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05662| All you have to do is scatter some fish and flesh from a nearby burrow, where a mongoose lives, to the snake's hollow. 
train_hindifullfemale_05663| When the mongoose will come following the food and reach the snake's home, he will certainly kill him! 
train_hindifullfemale_05664| The crane agreed to do as the crab planned. 
train_hindifullfemale_05665| As anticipated, the mongoose saw the black snake while following the trail of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05666| They had a fight, and the mongoose killed the snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05667| After this, the mongoose realized that there were many cranes on the top of the trees. 
train_hindifullfemale_05668| In due course of time, the mongoose climbed up the trees and started killing the cranes, till all the cranes were destroyed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05669| The wise indeed say, the solution of the problem should not be worse than the problem itself. That is, while trying to solve the problem, you should not complicate the problem further. 
train_hindifullfemale_05670| Once there was a king, who had a pet monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_05671| This monkey was a fool, but was treated royally and moved freely in the king's palace. 
train_hindifullfemale_05672| He was also allowed to enter the king's personal rooms that were forbidden even for the confidential servants. 
train_hindifullfemale_05673| One afternoon, the king was asleep, while the monkey kept a watch. 
train_hindifullfemale_05674| All of a sudden, a fly came in the room and sat on the king's chest. 
train_hindifullfemale_05675| The monkey swayed her away, but the fly would only go away for some time and return on the king's chest again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05676| The monkey got very angry and excited. 
train_hindifullfemale_05677| The foolish monkey started chasing the fly with a sword. 
train_hindifullfemale_05678| As the fly sat on the king's chest again, the monkey hit the fly with all his might. 
train_hindifullfemale_05679| The fly flew away unharmed, but the king was severely wounded. 
train_hindifullfemale_05680| The wise indeed say, Beware of a foolish friend. He can cause you more harm than your enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_05681| There was a Brahmin in a certain town, who was a thief. 
train_hindifullfemale_05682| It was believed that he had become a thief due to ill actions in his previous life. 
train_hindifullfemale_05683| One day, four Brahmins arrived in this town from a far-off place, to sell some wares. 
train_hindifullfemale_05684| They had a successful business and earned a handful of money. 
train_hindifullfemale_05685| The thief watched them making money, and thought of stealing the money from them. 
train_hindifullfemale_05686| He approached them as a friend, and soon won their confidence by quoting eloquently from the Holy Scriptures. 
train_hindifullfemale_05687| He requested them to appoint him as their helping hand, to which they agreed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05688| One day, the Brahmins had sold all their wares. 
train_hindifullfemale_05689| They decided that it would not be proper for them to travel with all the money. 
train_hindifullfemale_05690| So, they purchased jewels with all the money that they had earned. 
train_hindifullfemale_05691| Then, they cut open their thighs and hid the jewels inside. 
train_hindifullfemale_05692| With the help of a special ointment, they healed their cuts. 
train_hindifullfemale_05693| In this manner, they concealed all their jewels. 
train_hindifullfemale_05694| But, all this happened during the time that the thief was in service. 
train_hindifullfemale_05695| So, he knew where they had hidden all their earnings. 
train_hindifullfemale_05696| The thief wondered, I have not got a chance to rob them till now. 
train_hindifullfemale_05697| If I can accompany them when they travel homewards, I may be able to get a chance to steal them on the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_05698| I can poison them on the way, and take away the precious jewels. 
train_hindifullfemale_05699| Later, when they started preparing to leave, the thief started weeping. 
train_hindifullfemale_05700| He said, Dear friends, the very thought of your departure makes me sad. 
train_hindifullfemale_05701| After so many days that we have been together and shared a bond of love, I will be left all alone after you depart. 
train_hindifullfemale_05702| Please take me along with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05703| The Brahmins were moved by his emotions, and decided to take him with them, and the five of them started the journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_05704| On their way, they were going through the jungle and were crossing an area controlled by a wild tribe. 
train_hindifullfemale_05705| The chief of the tribe had a magical crow as his pet, who could foresee many things. 
train_hindifullfemale_05706| As they came near their place, the crow screamed, Quick! They have treasure! Kill them and take their treasure! 
train_hindifullfemale_05707| When the tribesmen heard this, they captured the five friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_05708| They searched them and their belongings, even removed their clothes, but found nothing. 
train_hindifullfemale_05709| The chief said, You certainly have some treasure with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05710| The crow has never been wrong before. 
train_hindifullfemale_05711| Hand over your treasure to us, or we will kill you, as the crow suggests. 
train_hindifullfemale_05712| You may have eaten the treasure, and we may have to cut open your stomachs to recover them. Tell us the truth. 
train_hindifullfemale_05713| The thief, who was also a Brahmin, thought, If they kill any of them, and search their bodies, they will recover jewels from the body. 
train_hindifullfemale_05714| They will not believe me, and kill me too! 
train_hindifullfemale_05715| They will not find any jewel, is another matter, but I will die anyway. 
train_hindifullfemale_05716| Thus, the Brahmin-thief made a firm resolution and said to the chief, O Chief, you believe we have treasure hidden in our bodies. 
train_hindifullfemale_05717| But it will be a mistake to kill all of us to pay for the crow's misunderstanding! 
train_hindifullfemale_05718| I offer you myself. You may kill me, cut open my body to the very bones and see if you find any treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_05719| The chief agreed, and thus, the Brahmin-thief sacrificed himself. The tribesmen looked into every bit of his body, but found nothing. 
train_hindifullfemale_05720| The chief was very confused; he believed that the crow must somehow have misunderstood. 
train_hindifullfemale_05721| He humbly said to the remaining four Brahmins, O travellers, it was a mistake to kill your friend, for he did not have any hidden treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_05722| I will not further my mistake by killing any of you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05723| I release you from my captivity, please continue your journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_05724| In this manner, the four Brahmins, and the jewels were saved and continued their journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_05725| The wise indeed say, Better an intelligent enemy than a foolish friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_05726| There was a temple of Lord Shiva near a southern city called Mahilaropyam. 
train_hindifullfemale_05727| A holy sage used to live and look after the temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05728| He would visit the city everyday for alms, and return in the evening for meal. 
train_hindifullfemale_05729| He collected more than he required for himself, and would keep the excess in a bowl, and distribute it among poor workers, who cleaned and decorated the temple in return. 
train_hindifullfemale_05730| A mouse, who lived in a hole in the hermitage would creep in everyday and steal some of the food from the bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_05731| When the hermit realized that a mouse has been stealing the food, He tried all ways to stop it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05732| He hung the bowl as high as he could, and even tried to beat the mouse with a stick, but the mouse would find some way to reach the bowl and steal some food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05733| One day, a medicant came to visit the temple, and the sage. 
train_hindifullfemale_05734| But the hermit was absent-minded and looked for an opportunity to hit the mouse with his stick, lest it come again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05735| This made the medicant angry, I will not visit your hermitage again, for you are giving only vague and abstract replies to my queries. 
train_hindifullfemale_05736| You seem to be pre-occupied with something more important than talking to me! 
train_hindifullfemale_05737| The hermit humbly explained his troubles, and how the mouse keeps stealing from him, somehow or the other. 
train_hindifullfemale_05738| This mouse would even put a cat or a monkey to shame, when it comes to jumping and reaching my bowl! 
train_hindifullfemale_05739| I have tried everything. I keep hitting my bowl with my stick, even while talking to you, to save the food I keep for my workers being stolen from the mouse. 
train_hindifullfemale_05740| The medicant understood the hermit's troubles, and advised, A mouse that jumps more than it should be, a mouse that is faster than the others, must have some reason for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_05741| I am sure it must have accumulated a lot of food in his hole. 
train_hindifullfemale_05742| This is the reason that the mouse feels exalted, and has the energy to jump so high. 
train_hindifullfemale_05743| The mouse knows he has nothing to lose, and thus nothing to fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_05744| And thus, the holy man and the medicant concluded that if they can track the mouse to its hole, they will be able to reach a store of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_05745| They decided to follow the tracks of the mouse the very next morning. 
train_hindifullfemale_05746| They followed the mouse's tracks and arrived at the entrance of the hole. 
train_hindifullfemale_05747| At once, they started digging with a pickaxe and uncovered a huge collection of food stored by the mouse, which it guarded. 
train_hindifullfemale_05748| They collected the food and stored it safely in the temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05749| On the other hand, the mouse was very depressed on realizing the entire store of food that it had accumulated for so long had been lost. 
train_hindifullfemale_05750| It felt deeply dejected, and lost all its confidence. 
train_hindifullfemale_05751| The mouse had no food, and decided to jump for the bowl at nightfall. 
train_hindifullfemale_05752| But when it tried to reach the bowl, it realized that it had neither the strength, nor the confidence to reach the bowl. 
train_hindifullfemale_05753| During this time, the sage charged it with a stick. 
train_hindifullfemale_05754| It was so depressed, that it was not able to react quickly, and was hit. 
train_hindifullfemale_05755| It was not a deadly blow, but it was hurt. 
train_hindifullfemale_05756| Somehow, it managed to escape and left the temple at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_05757| It decided not to return to the temple again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05758| The wise indeed say, Strike at the source of the enemy's power to destroy him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05759| There was a village which was ruined by a strong earthquake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05760| With the houses and the streets shattered, the villagers abandoned the village to settle elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_05761| Despite being shattered, the vacant houses of this village had become homes for a large number of mice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05762| The mice found the place very comfortable and grew in numbers after some time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05763| There was a lake on the outskirts of the village, where a herd of elephants used to visit regularly to drink water and bathe. 
train_hindifullfemale_05764| These elephants used to travel through the abandoned village to reach the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05765| But as the herd of elephants travelled through the abandoned village, everyday many mice got trampled. 
train_hindifullfemale_05766| This posed a problem for the mice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05767| So, the king of mice decided to confront the elephants and request them to act accordingly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05768| Next day, as the herd of elephants approached, the king of mice met the elephants cordially and said, O Sirs, we live in the ruins of this abandoned village and as you travel through this village, everyday many mice get trampled. 
train_hindifullfemale_05769| Therefore, I request you to change your route to the lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05770| If you do so, I shall remember to return the favour in your time of need. 
train_hindifullfemale_05771| At this the king of elephants laughed, O king of Mice, there will be no such favour that we, the giant elephants, will require from you, small mice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05772| However, I will honour your request and we will change the route to the lake from today. 
train_hindifullfemale_05773| You will not have to worry about any danger caused by us anymore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05774| The king of mice thanked the king of the elephants for his consideration, and the herd of elephants never entered the village anymore. 
train_hindifullfemale_05775| After some time, the herd of elephants fell into traps set by elephant-hunters. 
train_hindifullfemale_05776| Many of the elephants, including their king, got entangled in the nets. 
train_hindifullfemale_05777| They struggled hard but could not set themselves free from the strong nets. 
train_hindifullfemale_05778| Suddenly, the king of the elephants remembered the promise of the king of mice. 
train_hindifullfemale_05779| He summoned another elephant who had not got trapped to remind the king of mice of his promise and plea for help on his behalf. 
train_hindifullfemale_05780| As soon as the elephant informed the king of mice of the situation, the king of mice summoned all mice at once. 
train_hindifullfemale_05781| He said, Now is the time for us to return the favour of the elephants. We should go immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_05782| And so, the elephant brought the mice to the place where the other elephants had been trapped. 
train_hindifullfemale_05783| All the mice started nibbling on the strong nets and cut them loose. 
train_hindifullfemale_05784| The elephants broke loose from the nets and were grateful to be free again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05785| The king of elephants thanked the king of mice for his timely help, and became great friends thereafter. 
train_hindifullfemale_05786| The wise indeed say, Never underestimate anybody by their appearances. 
train_hindifullfemale_05787| There was a learned Brahmin, who lived in the outskirts of a city, with his wife called Shandili. 
train_hindifullfemale_05788| They were a happy couple but they were poor. 
train_hindifullfemale_05789| One morning, the Brahmin said to his wife, Tomorrow is an auspicious day, there is a special festival. 
train_hindifullfemale_05790| It will be a favourable time for alms. 
train_hindifullfemale_05791| I shall visit the city, and I am sure to collect a lot of alms tomorrow to last us long. 
train_hindifullfemale_05792| He continued, At the same time, you must also invite a Brahmin, and provide him food and clothes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05793| It is an auspicious day, and it will be a good deed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05794| When the wife heard this, she said, How come you say this? I cannot invite any Brahmin as we are already very poor. 
train_hindifullfemale_05795| We have neither good food, nor good clothes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05796| I cannot afford to invite any Brahmin! 
train_hindifullfemale_05797| But the Brahmin explained, Dear wife, even when we have a mouthful to eat, we must share half of it with someone in need. 
train_hindifullfemale_05798| After much convincing, the Brahmani agreed, I have some sesame seeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05799| I will clean and remove their husks, and cook a tasty dish for a Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_05800| The next morning, the Brahmin left for the city as planned. 
train_hindifullfemale_05801| After he was gone, his wife cleaned the sesame seeds in warm water, and carefully removed their husks. 
train_hindifullfemale_05802| She then put the sesame seeds outside in the sun to dry. 
train_hindifullfemale_05803| Meanwhile, she started doing her household chores. 
train_hindifullfemale_05804| During this time, a dog came and dirtied the sesame seeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05805| The Brahmani saw it, and immediately shooed the dog away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05806| She thought, Fate has undone my efforts. 
train_hindifullfemale_05807| But these sesame seeds are all that I have. 
train_hindifullfemale_05808| So, I will play a trick with the neighbour. 
train_hindifullfemale_05809| I will offer to exchange these cleaned, un-husked sesame seeds with some husked sesame seeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05810| They will not suspect, and fall for the offer. 
train_hindifullfemale_05811| She went to her neighbour and proposed an exchange. 
train_hindifullfemale_05812| The lady of the house was overwhelmed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05813| It takes a lot of time to clean and remove the husks of the sesame seed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05814| She found the offer very attractive, and offered some more sesame seeds in return. 
train_hindifullfemale_05815| As they were in the middle of the exchange, the neighbour's son came out. 
train_hindifullfemale_05816| He said, Mother! Who would exchange cleaned sesame seeds with unclean ones? 
train_hindifullfemale_05817| There must be some reason that she offers such lucrative offer. 
train_hindifullfemale_05818| Please do not accept the exchange. 
train_hindifullfemale_05819| When the lady heard her son's advice, she turned the offer down politely. 
train_hindifullfemale_05820| When Shandili realized that she had failed to play the trick on her neighbour, she returned home. 
train_hindifullfemale_05821| The wise indeed say, When someone offers you something that is too good to be true, don't be carried away by it - Think and analyse. 
train_hindifullfemale_05822| Sagardatta was a merchant who had a handsome young son. 
train_hindifullfemale_05823| One day, he saw that his young son and bought a costly book. 
train_hindifullfemale_05824| But the book contained only one verse, You get what is destined for you! 
train_hindifullfemale_05825| When the merchant realized that his son was a fool to buy a book with so much cost, but only one verse, he grew very angry. 
train_hindifullfemale_05826| He said, How can you do well in business, when you can buy a book which contains only one verse! 
train_hindifullfemale_05827| Get out of my house, and never show me your face again! 
train_hindifullfemale_05828| The young man was utterly dejected for being driven out by his father; he started travelling with only his book along with him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05829| He learnt the verse well, and kept repeating it, all the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_05830| On his way, he arrived in a village. 
train_hindifullfemale_05831| The villagers asked him his name and he replied from the book, You get what is destined for you 
train_hindifullfemale_05832| Thus, the young man became known as You-get-what-is-destined-for-you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05833| One day, the princess of the country visited a festival and saw a handsome prince, who was also attending the festival. 
train_hindifullfemale_05834| She fell in love immediately and asked her attendant to find a way to send a message to the handsome prince. 
train_hindifullfemale_05835| She wrote a note, and gave it to her attendant. The attendant gave the note to the young merchant's son by mistake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05836| He read that she wrote, I have fallen in love with you, the very moment I have set my eyes on you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05837| Please meet me in the castle. 
train_hindifullfemale_05838| You will find a rope hanging from one of the windows, which will lead you to my room. 
train_hindifullfemale_05839| He thought, I will honour the wishes of the princess to meet me in person. 
train_hindifullfemale_05840| When he climbed up the rope, and entered the princess's room, it was very dark. 
train_hindifullfemale_05841| The princess thought he was the prince at the festival, and received him warmly. 
train_hindifullfemale_05842| She served him food and drink, and entertained him in every manner. 
train_hindifullfemale_05843| She said, I have deeply fallen in love with you. I shall have no other man as my husband, except for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05844| Please tell me what you have in your mind. 
train_hindifullfemale_05845| The merchant's son replied, You get what is destined for you 
train_hindifullfemale_05846| She was surprised to hear the prince speak so, and immediately enlightened her room. 
train_hindifullfemale_05847| She got furious when she realized he was not the handsome prince, she thought him to be, and ordered him out of her room. 
train_hindifullfemale_05848| The young man was sad on being treated in such manner without being at fault, and walked to a nearby temple. 
train_hindifullfemale_05849| He decided to spend the night there, and fell asleep. 
train_hindifullfemale_05850| The temple remained un-inhabitated and the night watchman carried out tasks of ill repute during the night. 
train_hindifullfemale_05851| He wanted the young man to leave and said, This temple is old and broken. You may sleep in my home. 
train_hindifullfemale_05852| Thus, the young man went to his house. 
train_hindifullfemale_05853| But he made a mistake and got into the wrong room, where the watchman's daughter was waiting for her lover to arrive during her father's absence. 
train_hindifullfemale_05854| In the darkness of the night, the watchman's daughter mistook him for her lover and exchanged garlands in front of the picture of God. 
train_hindifullfemale_05855| Thus, according to traditions they got married. 
train_hindifullfemale_05856| The young man said, You get what is destined for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05857| When she heard this, she realized she had done a mistake, and thought, Such mistake is bound to happen, when you rush into doing something without thinking sufficiently about it! 
train_hindifullfemale_05858| She cursed him and threw him out of the house. 
train_hindifullfemale_05859| Saddened by being treated in such manner without being at fault, he was walking slowly, when he saw a marriage procession approaching. 
train_hindifullfemale_05860| They had magnificent clothes, and wore precious jewels. 
train_hindifullfemale_05861| He followed the groom's procession, which was going to the bride's home, where a lavish ceremony was arranged. 
train_hindifullfemale_05862| All of a sudden, a mad elephant rushed towards the procession, and everybody ran helter-skelter. 
train_hindifullfemale_05863| The bride stood there in the middle of the turmoil, too afraid to run. 
train_hindifullfemale_05864| When he saw this, the young man got hold of a huge nail, and jabbed it into the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05865| The elephant got frightened and ran away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05866| After a while, when the bride's friends and relatives returned, she said, At the moment when my life was in danger, there was none to help me except for this courageous stranger. 
train_hindifullfemale_05867| I will marry none other than him. This is my firm resolution. 
train_hindifullfemale_05868| The groom's friends and relatives were offended by these words, and there was a heated argument. 
train_hindifullfemale_05869| When the words reached around, the king had to come himself to pacify everybody and stop the argument. 
train_hindifullfemale_05870| Everyone including the princess and the watchman's daughter came to the place. 
train_hindifullfemale_05871| The king asked the young man, You were present in the ceremony. 
train_hindifullfemale_05872| You saved the would-be bride and everybody from the elephant, it is said. 
train_hindifullfemale_05873| I ask you to explain the whole thing to me! 
train_hindifullfemale_05874| All the young man said was, You get what is destined for you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05875| The princess and the watchman's daughter were embarrassed to hear the words. 
train_hindifullfemale_05876| When the king heard this and saw the princess and the watchman's daughter blushing, he demanded to know the truth. 
train_hindifullfemale_05877| The night watchman's daughter confessed of marrying him by mistake, and said, It was my destiny, and I do not repent it! 
train_hindifullfemale_05878| The princess explained to the king that she had spent time with him by mistake, and said, It was my destiny, and I do not regret it! 
train_hindifullfemale_05879| On hearing them, the bride confronted the king and said, O King, what destiny has given to me, none can take away from me! 
train_hindifullfemale_05880| After hearing everybody and consulting his ministers, the king arranged for a ceremony. 
train_hindifullfemale_05881| He gifted the young merchant's son with a thousand villages, apart from ornaments and golds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05882| He married the young man with his young princess, and made him his heir to the throne. 
train_hindifullfemale_05883| The bride-in-waiting, and the watchman's daughter were also married to him, by their respective parents, in the same ceremony. 
train_hindifullfemale_05884| When he built his own castle, he arranged for his parents and relatives to be brought to his place, and they all lived happily ever after. 
train_hindifullfemale_05885| The wise indeed say, Do your best but leave it to destiny. 
train_hindifullfemale_05886| Once, there lived a cloth-weaver called Somilaka, who wove very exquisite clothes that served only kings and princes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05887| However, he earned very less and could hardly afford to live. 
train_hindifullfemale_05888| Other weavers in the locality were rich, despite the fact that they weaved much inferior clothes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05889| One day, he said to his wife, My dear, this place does not deserve me! 
train_hindifullfemale_05890| I weave superior clothes, and yet I earn so little. 
train_hindifullfemale_05891| On the other hand, the other weavers grow richer by the day with their inferior clothes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05892| I shall seek my success somewhere else. 
train_hindifullfemale_05893| His wife, however, did not want to leave, for there was no assurance of betterment somewhere else. 
train_hindifullfemale_05894| But the weaver had made up his mind, and left the place in search of better prospects. 
train_hindifullfemale_05895| He went to another city, where he indeed was successful. 
train_hindifullfemale_05896| His clothes became popular for the high quality, and in three years he had saved three hundred coins of gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_05897| Now that he was rich, he decided to return home to his hometown and his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_05898| During his journey, in the middle of the jungle, he heard two voices. 
train_hindifullfemale_05899| Destiny: Action, you should not have let the weaver earn three hundred coins of gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_05900| He does not require that much for his living! 
train_hindifullfemale_05901| Action: Destiny, I had to reward him according to his efforts, but you may decide how much he should retain! 
train_hindifullfemale_05902| He checked into his bag to find that the gold coins were lost. 
train_hindifullfemale_05903| He became very sad. 
train_hindifullfemale_05904| He thought, I will not be able to face my wife! All my efforts for the last three years have been lost. 
train_hindifullfemale_05905| So, he discontinued his journey, and returned to the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_05906| He worked very hard, and within a year, earned five hundred gold coins. 
train_hindifullfemale_05907| Now that he was rich again, he decided to return home to his wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_05908| During his journey, in the middle of the jungle, he heard the two voices again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05909| Destiny: Action, you should not have let the weaver earn five hundred coins of gold. He does not require that much for his living! 
train_hindifullfemale_05910| Action: Destiny, I had to reward him according to his efforts, but you may decide how much he should retain! 
train_hindifullfemale_05911| When he heard this, remembering the last time, he quickly checked into the bag and found that the gold coins were missing. 
train_hindifullfemale_05912| He became very sad, and wished he died. 
train_hindifullfemale_05913| He sat down and thought, There is no point in living. 
train_hindifullfemale_05914| I have lost my money again, and cannot face my wife in this state of poverty! I shall hand myself on a tree! 
train_hindifullfemale_05915| He wove a rope from the nearby grass, and tied it in a Banyan tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_05916| He made a noose around his neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_05917| Just as he was about to hang himself, he heard a voice from heaven, I am Destiny! I have taken the gold coins from you as you did not need the money for your living. 
train_hindifullfemale_05918| But I am pleased with your industrious deeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05919| I permit you to ask for a boon that I shall grant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05920| Somilaka replied, Please give a lot of gold coins, that is the only boon that I ask you to grant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05921| Destiny asked, You are not destined to earn more than you need for a living. 
train_hindifullfemale_05922| Why do you ask for the money that you cannot enjoy? 
train_hindifullfemale_05923| But the weaver was adamant. So, the wish was granted. 
train_hindifullfemale_05924| I shall grant you your wish, but you must return back to the city and visit any two merchant's house. 
train_hindifullfemale_05925| Study their behaviour and let me know how you would like your money to be. 
train_hindifullfemale_05926| So, he discontinued his journey once again, and returned to the city. 
train_hindifullfemale_05927| He went into a merchant's house, and was greeted as a guest according to local traditions. 
train_hindifullfemale_05928| This merchant was very rich, he did not like this unwanted guest. 
train_hindifullfemale_05929| They gave him food in the most insulting manner, and offered a dirty bed for the night. 
train_hindifullfemale_05930| At night, he heard the two voices again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05931| Destiny: Action, you should not have let the merchant provide food to the weaver. He has forced himself as an unwanted guest! 
train_hindifullfemale_05932| Action: Destiny, the weaver needed to be provided for the night, and the merchant did so in his miserly ways, but you may decide the outcome! 
train_hindifullfemale_05933| Next morning, he went into another merchant's house, where he was warmly welcomed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05934| He was provided with new clothes and water to bathe. 
train_hindifullfemale_05935| He was then served a lavish dinner, and a comfortable bed to sleep in. 
train_hindifullfemale_05936| During his stay, he realized that the second merchant was not rich. 
train_hindifullfemale_05937| At night, he heard the two voices again. 
train_hindifullfemale_05938| Destiny: Action, you should not have let the merchant provide entertain the weaver so extravagantly. He has forced himself as an unwanted guest! 
train_hindifullfemale_05939| Action: Destiny, the weaver needed to be provided for the night, and the merchant did so in his generous ways, but you may decide the outcome! 
train_hindifullfemale_05940| Next morning, the weaver watched the king's servants bring money for the second merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05941| Destiny had rewarded him for his good deeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_05942| The weaver thought, The second merchant is not rich, but he leads a life which is better than the first merchant, who is very rich. 
train_hindifullfemale_05943| On his way homewards, the voice from heaven asked, How do you want your money to be? 
train_hindifullfemale_05944| The weaver at once said, Please give me only the money that I will be able to enjoy to the fullest like the second merchant. 
train_hindifullfemale_05945| His wish was granted, and Somilaka returned home with some money that made his wife happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_05946| They lived happily, and were content with whatever they earned. 
train_hindifullfemale_05947| The wise indeed say, Action and destiny are two sides of a coin. Work with all your might but leave it to destiny. And stay happy and content. 
train_hindifullfemale_05948| Once upon a time, all the birds - the swans, cranes, parrots, cuckoos, owls, peacocks, doves and the rest of them - decided to meet. 
train_hindifullfemale_05949| They had to discuss a subject of most importance. 
train_hindifullfemale_05950| Unfortunately, no crow had joined yet, but they could not wait any longer. 
train_hindifullfemale_05951| They debated, Garuda, who is the king of all birds, is always busy in serving his master. 
train_hindifullfemale_05952| He has neither the time, nor the interest to bother about us! 
train_hindifullfemale_05953| There is no point in having a king who does not protect and remains at the position of the king only as a namesake. 
train_hindifullfemale_05954| And so the birds discussed, Let us choose a king amongst us! 
train_hindifullfemale_05955| On this, they started looking at each other; suddenly the features of owl attracted everybody. 
train_hindifullfemale_05956| He was powerful, had impressive features, and most importantly he could see at night, when they were most unsafe. 
train_hindifullfemale_05957| They agreed that the owl would be an apt king for themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_05958| They shouted, The owl should be our king! Let us prepare for the coronation at once! 
train_hindifullfemale_05959| As decided, the birds collected 108 holy roots, water from the holy rivers, and prepared a lavish and highly decorated throne. 
train_hindifullfemale_05960| They even spread the ground in front of the throne with tiger skin. 
train_hindifullfemale_05961| The Brahmins, they had invited, started chanting from holy books, while the birds beat drums, and beautiful maidens blew conches and sand songs of joy. 
train_hindifullfemale_05962| With a map of all the continents and oceans drawn, the owl was prepared to be crowned. 
train_hindifullfemale_05963| At the moment the owl was being accompanied to the throne to be crowned, a crow arrived. 
train_hindifullfemale_05964| He asked curiously, Please let me know the reason of this great gathering, and lavish celebration! 
train_hindifullfemale_05965| The crow was indeed known for his smartness, and the birds decided to explain and take his opinion. 
train_hindifullfemale_05966| The birds explained, O Crow, Garuda has no time to bother about us. 
train_hindifullfemale_05967| So, we have decided to denounce him as our king and have elected the owl to be our new king. 
train_hindifullfemale_05968| Since, you have just joined, please provide us with your opinion also. 
train_hindifullfemale_05969| The crow smiled and replied, In my opinion, I should advise against crowning the owl as our king! 
train_hindifullfemale_05970| He continued to explain, The owl is blind by the day. And look at him. Why have an ugly king, when the birds are known for their beauty. 
train_hindifullfemale_05971| We have the peacocks, swans, nightingales, pigeons and so many more who look so beautiful. And look at him, he looks so cruel with his crooked nose and squint eyes. 
train_hindifullfemale_05972| How would he look if he was angry? I certainly advise against crowning him. 
train_hindifullfemale_05973| The other birds started considering his points, and the crow continues with his arguments, And what do we gain from electing him as our king? We already have Garuda as our king. 
train_hindifullfemale_05974| The mere mention of his name would keep our enemies away! 
train_hindifullfemale_05975| It is not necessary at all, for us to elect a new king and denounce Garuda! 
train_hindifullfemale_05976| On hearing this logic, the birds started pondering, his arguments are right. The entire reason for our meeting serves no purpose. 
train_hindifullfemale_05977| Let us think awhile and meet some other time. 
train_hindifullfemale_05978| One by one, the birds started flying away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05979| Even the Brahmins and beautiful maidens started to leave. 
train_hindifullfemale_05980| The crow was still sitting on the branch of a tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_05981| Unable to understand the commotion, the owl and his wife were still waiting to be crowned king and queen. 
train_hindifullfemale_05982| The owl asked his wife, What is happening? Why is the crowning ceremoney yet to begin? Why have all the birds left? 
train_hindifullfemale_05983| His wife replied, As I understand, the crow put an obstacle in the crowning ceremony. 
train_hindifullfemale_05984| He persuaded all the other birds to fly away. 
train_hindifullfemale_05985| Only he, with ulterior motives, stayed behind. We should return home, too. 
train_hindifullfemale_05986| On hearing this, the owl got very disappointed. 
train_hindifullfemale_05987| He shouted to the crow, You are a wicked bird. 
train_hindifullfemale_05988| I did not harm you in any way, and yet you put obstacle to my crowning ceremony. 
train_hindifullfemale_05989| From today, I end all friendly relationship with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_05990| From now onwards, our kind and your kind will be nothing but enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_05991| The owl left with his wife, to return to his home. The crow was left alone. 
train_hindifullfemale_05992| With everybody else gone, he decided to leave too. 
train_hindifullfemale_05993| While flying off, he thought, Why did I speak my mind? My advice to the birds was not required. 
train_hindifullfemale_05994| It is because of my advice, that crows will always have the mighty owls as their enemies. 
train_hindifullfemale_05995| The wise indeed say, Keep your counsel to yourself and thus stay away from trouble. 
train_hindifullfemale_05996| Deep in the jungle, there lived a big group of elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_05997| The elephants lived in a certain place beside a pond, and did not require venturing out. 
train_hindifullfemale_05998| There came a time, when the pond started drying up due to lack of rain for a few years. 
train_hindifullfemale_05999| Some of the elephants met the king of the elephants, and said, Your Majesty! We do not have any more water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06000| Some of our little ones are on the verge of death. 
train_hindifullfemale_06001| We must find some other place which has abundant water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06002| After thinking a while, the elephant king said, I remember knowing a place where there is a very big lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_06003| It must still be full of water. Let us go there. 
train_hindifullfemale_06004| Next morning they started to march. 
train_hindifullfemale_06005| After travelling for five days and five nights, the elephants finally reached the place. 
train_hindifullfemale_06006| There was indeed a big lake, full of water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06007| There were innumerable holes in the soft earth around the lake, in which a group of hares lived. 
train_hindifullfemale_06008| When the elephants saw so much water in the lake, they rejoiced, and started jumping into the water without a care in the world. 
train_hindifullfemale_06009| All this sudden commotion caused the holes to be destroyed. 
train_hindifullfemale_06010| Many hares were trampled under the elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_06011| While many died, many others were seriously injured. 
train_hindifullfemale_06012| But the hares could do nothing to stop this misery, and those who ran away could save themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_06013| When the elephants left in the evening, the hares that had run away started returning. 
train_hindifullfemale_06014| They assembled in sorrow, Oh dear! Because of scarcity of water everywhere else, the elephants will come here every day. 
train_hindifullfemale_06015| We must think of something, or more of us will get trampled tomorrow. 
train_hindifullfemale_06016| What can we do against the mighty elephants? We must leave this place to survive. 
train_hindifullfemale_06017| One of the hares disagreed, Friends! This is our ancestral home. 
train_hindifullfemale_06018| If we can frighten the elephants off, they will not return. 
train_hindifullfemale_06019| I can think of a way to frighten them away. 
train_hindifullfemale_06020| We may be only small hares, but we are capable of executing my plan. 
train_hindifullfemale_06021| As planned, a hare sat on a hillock which was on the path of the elephants. 
train_hindifullfemale_06022| After a while the king of the elephants came with the rest of his herd. 
train_hindifullfemale_06023| The hare shouted, You wicked elephant! I prohibit you to enter the lake. This lake belongs to the Moon-God. Go back at once! 
train_hindifullfemale_06024| The king of the elephants was taken a back. 
train_hindifullfemale_06025| But he would not dare to enrage any God either. 
train_hindifullfemale_06026| He asked what message the hare had for him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06027| The hare said, I am the messenger of the Moon God. 
train_hindifullfemale_06028| He has sent me to inform you that he forbids you from entering his lake. 
train_hindifullfemale_06029| Yesterday, many hares were trampled due to your visit. 
train_hindifullfemale_06030| The hares live under the protection of the Moon God, and he is very angry with you. 
train_hindifullfemale_06031| If you wish to survive, you should not enter the lake again. 
train_hindifullfemale_06032| The elephant king kept quiet for some time, and then said, If that is so. Tell me where your Moon-God is, and I will go away with my herd, once we have asked for his forgiveness. 
train_hindifullfemale_06033| It was already evening, so the hare said, The Moon God has come down to his lake to console the families of the hares who got killed yesterday. If you want to meet him, come with me! 
train_hindifullfemale_06034| The clever hare led the king of the elephant to the bank of the lake from where the reflection of the moon could be seen in the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06035| He said, He is very aggrieved today, please bow to him silently and leave. 
train_hindifullfemale_06036| You must not disturb his meditation. Otherwise, he will be furious. 
train_hindifullfemale_06037| The king of the elephant was wonder-struck on seeing the moon in the water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06038| He believed the hare, and left trembling as soon as he bowed respectfully. 
train_hindifullfemale_06039| And so, the hares lived happily, without being disturbed by the elephants anymore. 
train_hindifullfemale_06040| The wise indeed say, The weak must make use of all tactics to survive. 
train_hindifullfemale_06041| Two partridges lived in a certain tree in a jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_06042| While one of them lived on the branches, the other lived inside a hole at the foot of the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_06043| They became good friends, and they would spend long hours with each other telling each other stories and events of their lives. 
train_hindifullfemale_06044| In this manner, the partridges spent their time in happiness. 
train_hindifullfemale_06045| One day, one of them went away with some more partidges in search of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_06046| As was usual, when he did not return back even at sunset, the other partridge started worrying. 
train_hindifullfemale_06047| He thought, He has not done this ever. 
train_hindifullfemale_06048| Why has the partridge not returned home today? Has been trapped by some hunter? Or maybe even killed? I cannot live without him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06049| I am certain there is some reason why he has not returned even at nightfall. 
train_hindifullfemale_06050| He did not return even the next day, or the day after. 
train_hindifullfemale_06051| For several days, the partridge kept worrying, and then gave up hope of his friend's return. And so, I spent several days worrying. 
train_hindifullfemale_06052| On nightfall, a hare came to the tree and observing an empty hole at the foot of the tree, took shelter inside. 
train_hindifullfemale_06053| Since, the partridge had given up hope, he did not object to the hole being occupied by the hare. 
train_hindifullfemale_06054| After a few days the partridge returned. 
train_hindifullfemale_06055| He had gone to a place where there was plenty of food to eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_06056| He had grown fat, but remembering his dear friend, he thought of returning. 
train_hindifullfemale_06057| On his return, when he found that a hare had taken over his house, he objected strongly, Hare! This hole is my home, and you have taken over during my absence. 
train_hindifullfemale_06058| This is very unfair of you. I demand you to leave immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_06059| The hare disagreed, This place is mine now. I am not leaving. 
train_hindifullfemale_06060| I found this hole empty, and therefore made it my home. Thus, they began to quarrel. 
train_hindifullfemale_06061| The partridge understood there was no point in quarrelling with the hare, and said, Hare! You seem to lack the basic ethics. 
train_hindifullfemale_06062| Let us approach someone holy and knowledgeable. 
train_hindifullfemale_06063| Let someone well-versed in holy books decide who is right, and thus, who shall have the right to occupy the hole. 
train_hindifullfemale_06064| The hare agreed, and as suggested they went to look for a holy man to settle their dispute. 
train_hindifullfemale_06065| Meanwhile, a wild tomcat became aware that they wanted to settle their dispute through a holy man. 
train_hindifullfemale_06066| He quickly posed as a learned animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_06067| He held a blade of holy Kusha grass in his paw and stood on the bank of a river, where he will be quickly spotted. 
train_hindifullfemale_06068| Standing on his hind legs, with his eyes closed, he started chanting. 
train_hindifullfemale_06069| When the partridge and the hare came across him, the hare said, He looks holy, and a learned person. Let us go and seek his advice. 
train_hindifullfemale_06070| The partridge agreed but said, Yes, let us seek his opinion. But he is a wild cat by birth, and a natural enemy for both of us. 
train_hindifullfemale_06071| We should be careful, and speak only from a distance. 
train_hindifullfemale_06072| As decided, they came to the wild tomcat, but stood at a distance. 
train_hindifullfemale_06073| Holy person! We have a dispute amongst us. 
train_hindifullfemale_06074| Will you please settle our dispute and advice us who is right in accordance to Holy Scriptures. 
train_hindifullfemale_06075| If you decide that one of us has sinned, you may as well eat him! 
train_hindifullfemale_06076| The tomcat replied, O my friends, I have denounced the violent life as it leads to hell. 
train_hindifullfemale_06077| Non-violence is the very essence of true religion. 
train_hindifullfemale_06078| I shall not harm any of you. However, I will hear both of you and settle your dispute with the knowledge I have gained. 
train_hindifullfemale_06079| Both the partridge and the hare were impressed. 
train_hindifullfemale_06080| The wild tomcat continued, But I am old, and cannot hear you from that distance. 
train_hindifullfemale_06081| Fear not! I do not even harm a lice, bug or a mosquito. 
train_hindifullfemale_06082| Come close, and explain the reason of your dispute. 
train_hindifullfemale_06083| I shall make the most just settlement. 
train_hindifullfemale_06084| With all these sayings, he won the confidence of both of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_06085| Both the partridge and the hare came near him and sat close to him to explain the reason of their dispute. 
train_hindifullfemale_06086| This was the very opportunity that the tomcat was looking for. 
train_hindifullfemale_06087| As soon as they sat beside him, he jumped and seized one of them in his teeth and the other with his claws. 
train_hindifullfemale_06088| He killed both of them and made a meal out of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_06089| The wise indeed say, Beware of a rascal who pretends to be holy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06090| There was a mean hunter, who used to roam in the jungle in search of birds and other small animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_06091| He looked like Yama, and was so heartless that he was deserted by all his friends and relatives for his cruel deeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_06092| In the very same jungle, there lived a happy couple of doves. 
train_hindifullfemale_06093| They had built a beautiful nest in the top of a big tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_06094| One evening, the hunter caught hold of the female dove when she was alone, and trapped her into a cage. 
train_hindifullfemale_06095| He was looking for more hunting, when a sudden storm broke in. 
train_hindifullfemale_06096| It was accompanied by heavy rains. 
train_hindifullfemale_06097| Terrified, he began searching for shelter from the rain and the gusty wind. 
train_hindifullfemale_06098| He could not find any shelter, but luckily found a big tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_06099| Shivering in rain and cold, he took shelter under the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_06100| This happened to be the very tree where the female dove he had caught lived. 
train_hindifullfemale_06101| After some time, the rain started to cease and the sky started to clear. 
train_hindifullfemale_06102| But it was late into the night, so the hunter decided to spend the night under the tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_06103| He prayed, O spirit of the tree, or whoever lives here, I take shelter under this tree for the night. 
train_hindifullfemale_06104| I am drenched in the rains, and suffer from cold and hunger. 
train_hindifullfemale_06105| Please protect me for the night. 
train_hindifullfemale_06106| Meanwhile, in the nest above, the male dove was very worried as his wife had not returned. 
train_hindifullfemale_06107| The fact that there was a storm even compounded his worries. 
train_hindifullfemale_06108| He said, I am so sad and worried that my wife has not returned. 
train_hindifullfemale_06109| Our home seems empty without her. 
train_hindifullfemale_06110| I am worried because the wind blows so fiercely, and it is already late in the night. 
train_hindifullfemale_06111| The female dove could hear her husband worrying from above, and she called out to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06112| The female dove said, I am being held by the hunter who has taken shelter under the very tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_06113| But I will tell you something that will be for your own good. 
train_hindifullfemale_06114| She continued, The guest is always God. 
train_hindifullfemale_06115| If someone ever comes to your house for shelter, one must do his best to him, even risking own life. 
train_hindifullfemale_06116| This hunter is cold and hungry. 
train_hindifullfemale_06117| Don't hate him because he has caged me. 
train_hindifullfemale_06118| Instead, welcome him because he seeks refugee from the night under your protection. 
train_hindifullfemale_06119| She explained, This hunter is not to be blamed that I have been caged by him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06120| But this must be the result of my past deeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_06121| Grievances like poverty, disease, imprisonment and even disaster come to own's life as a result of one's own deeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_06122| Thus, speaks our religion. 
train_hindifullfemale_06123| Please welcome him according to our traditions, and not hate him for me. 
train_hindifullfemale_06124| The male dove was touched by his wife's virtuous guidance, and he flew down and approached the hunter with warmth. 
train_hindifullfemale_06125| He said, O friend! Welcome to our tree. 
train_hindifullfemale_06126| Please don't worry about anything and stay in this place as long as you want. 
train_hindifullfemale_06127| Please tell me how I can be of assistance to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_06128| The hunter was relieved to have a friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_06129| He said, O dove, please do something to help me from this terrible cold. 
train_hindifullfemale_06130| The dove at once flew to a distant place and brought back a piece of burning coal. 
train_hindifullfemale_06131| He then climbed up the tree and dropped some dry leaves. The leaves caught fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_06132| He said to the hunter, Please warm yourself from this fire. 
train_hindifullfemale_06133| I am already unfortunate for not being able to provide food to relieve you of your hunger. 
train_hindifullfemale_06134| As you are my guest, I offer myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_06135| Please accept my sacrifice and make a meal out of me. 
train_hindifullfemale_06136| Saying so, he flew into the fire, which killed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06137| The hunter was very hungry, and could not refuse to accept his offer. 
train_hindifullfemale_06138| At the same time, he was moved by such warmth. 
train_hindifullfemale_06139| His heart was filled with pity. 
train_hindifullfemale_06140| He said, A man who is wicked always has a troubled mind. And he ultimately pays for his evil actions. 
train_hindifullfemale_06141| I am certain to go to hell, for the cruel misdeeds I have done for so long. 
train_hindifullfemale_06142| But this dove has set a virtuous example, and taught me a lesson of sacrifice. 
train_hindifullfemale_06143| He said, I will lead a life of discipline and well-being from today. 
train_hindifullfemale_06144| I promise to sacrifice all my lavish unwanted pleasures. 
train_hindifullfemale_06145| With this, he threw away his cage, which broke and released the unfortunate female dove. 
train_hindifullfemale_06146| When the female dove realized that her husband was already dead and was burning in the fire, she began to wail, What good is my life without you. I have lost all interest in life. 
train_hindifullfemale_06147| Saying so, she flew into the flames, which got her killed too. 
train_hindifullfemale_06148| After her death, she met her husband in heaven. 
train_hindifullfemale_06149| He was transformed into a divine creature, riding a chariot in costly ornaments. 
train_hindifullfemale_06150| The female dove realized, she had assumed a divine form, too. 
train_hindifullfemale_06151| As for the hunter, he renounced his life as a hunter and converted into a sage. 
train_hindifullfemale_06152| One day, when he saw a wild forest fire, he decided to sacrifice his life to regret his past deeds. 
train_hindifullfemale_06153| He, thus, paid for his sins and was relieved of his sins. He went to heaven with great joy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06154| The wise indeed say, Self-sacrifice is the highest stage of sacrifice. 
train_hindifullfemale_06155| Yudhisthira was the name of a poor potter who lived in a certain kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_06156| One night, when he was returning after drinking more than he should have, he stumbled and fell over some pots. 
train_hindifullfemale_06157| When he got up, he saw blood was oozing out of his forehead. 
train_hindifullfemale_06158| There was a deep cut due to a broken piece of pot. 
train_hindifullfemale_06159| Poor that he was, he did not go apply any medicine on his wound, which is the reason that the wound did not heal for a long time. 
train_hindifullfemale_06160| After a long time, the wound finally healed by itself, but it left a big scar on his forehead. 
train_hindifullfemale_06161| Soon afterwards, there was a famine in the country, and he decided to leave his place and travel to another part of the country. 
train_hindifullfemale_06162| On his way, he joined a group of people, who served at the royal household. 
train_hindifullfemale_06163| Along with them, he started serving at the royal household. 
train_hindifullfemale_06164| One day, the king noticed the big scar on his forehead and thought, This man must be a great warrior. 
train_hindifullfemale_06165| The scar on his forehead is evident that he has received such wound in some battle. 
train_hindifullfemale_06166| He must be very brave. 
train_hindifullfemale_06167| Thus, the king promoted him as a warrior and he was honoured with a place amongst the best warriors of the kingdom. 
train_hindifullfemale_06168| The other household workers knew that he was no warrior, and became jealous of the fact that the king favoured him, although he did not deserve it rightly. 
train_hindifullfemale_06169| Soonafter, a battle was impending and the king summoned all his warriors. 
train_hindifullfemale_06170| He wanted to speak to all the great warriors personally and gift them with precious items as an encouragement. 
train_hindifullfemale_06171| The king addressed the soldiers with encouraging words and inspected the equipments, and weapons, and even the elephants and horses. 
train_hindifullfemale_06172| On the other hand, the potter was no real warrior, and he feared going into the battleground. 
train_hindifullfemale_06173| All the preparations for battle made him tense. 
train_hindifullfemale_06174| But he was resolved to prove himself as a warrior in the battleground. 
train_hindifullfemale_06175| While inspecting, the king noticed the potter. 
train_hindifullfemale_06176| He took him aside and asked, O Warrior, fighting which battle did you get this deadly scar? 
train_hindifullfemale_06177| The potter replied, O king, this scar was not caused by any wound by any sword. 
train_hindifullfemale_06178| Being a potter by profession myself, my home was full of pots. 
train_hindifullfemale_06179| One night, I tripped after drinking more than I should have, I tripped over them that caused this wound. 
train_hindifullfemale_06180| Due to improper attention, the wound left this big scar. 
train_hindifullfemale_06181| When the king heard the truth, he felt embarrassed for his earlier decision. 
train_hindifullfemale_06182| He asked his soldiers, He is a potter, who has deceived me by pretending to be a warrior. 
train_hindifullfemale_06183| Drive him away from the army! 
train_hindifullfemale_06184| The potter fell on his knees, and pleaded to the king, O King, please do not do this. 
train_hindifullfemale_06185| Have mercy on me, for I am sure I will be able to prove my bravery on the battleground. 
train_hindifullfemale_06186| Please give me a chance to prove my worth. 
train_hindifullfemale_06187| The king replied, You may have excellent qualities, and you may be brave. 
train_hindifullfemale_06188| But you do not possess the qualities required on the battleground. 
train_hindifullfemale_06189| When the other warriors will come to know that you are only a potter, they will ridicule you. 
train_hindifullfemale_06190| You will get yourself killed on the battleground! 
train_hindifullfemale_06191| It is better if you leave, and return to your home. 
train_hindifullfemale_06192| The potter understood the king's advice, and left the palace immediately. 
train_hindifullfemale_06193| The wise indeed say, Continue being what you are, else you pay for it. 
train_hindifullfemale_06194| A lion and a lioness couple lived in the jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_06195| They were very happy, as they had given birth to two male cubs, and had newly become parents. 
train_hindifullfemale_06196| The lion was responsible for hunting and providing food for the lion and the two cubs. 
train_hindifullfemale_06197| So, everyday, he would go out in the morning and would come back within evening with food, and provide it to the lioness, who fed the cubs and herself. 
train_hindifullfemale_06198| One day, it was nearing sunset and the lion had not found any prey after wandering throughout the jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_06199| He thought of returning empty-handed. 
train_hindifullfemale_06200| On his way, he found a baby jackal. 
train_hindifullfemale_06201| He would finally be able to provide food for his family. 
train_hindifullfemale_06202| But he took pity on the jackal, because it was just a baby. 
train_hindifullfemale_06203| So, instead of killing him, the lion carried the baby jackal home and presented him to the lioness. 
train_hindifullfemale_06204| The lioness said, My dear, He is only a baby. 
train_hindifullfemale_06205| How can I kill and eat the jackal that you have not killed yourself. 
train_hindifullfemale_06206| Let us then raise the jackal with our own cubs. 
train_hindifullfemale_06207| They will soon like each other and play together as brothers. 
train_hindifullfemale_06208| And so, the lion and the lioness started caring and raising him as their own, without making any differentiation or partiality towards any of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_06209| However, as they grew up, they behaved differently and often fought among themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_06210| This was because the jackal had different traits of his species. 
train_hindifullfemale_06211| But the lion and the lioness overlooked their childhood actions. 
train_hindifullfemale_06212| One day, as they were playing near their den, a wild elephant approached them. 
train_hindifullfemale_06213| While the young jackal prepared to flee, the young lions rushed forward to attack. 
train_hindifullfemale_06214| The young jackal said, He is a natural enemy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06215| Come with me, let us go home. 
train_hindifullfemale_06216| The young lions followed him back, but they were amazed by their brother's cowardice. 
train_hindifullfemale_06217| They laughed at their brother, and made fun of him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06218| They even mocked and told the story to their parents. 
train_hindifullfemale_06219| This made the jackal very angry. 
train_hindifullfemale_06220| When the mother lioness talked to the young jackal later, the jackal said, I am not inferior to them in any action. 
train_hindifullfemale_06221| May it be bravery, or looks or education or intelligence. 
train_hindifullfemale_06222| Look at how they ridicule me! 
train_hindifullfemale_06223| I have promised myself that I will kill them as my revenge! 
train_hindifullfemale_06224| When the lioness heard these words, she knew immediately what to do. 
train_hindifullfemale_06225| She said, My son, what you say is true. 
train_hindifullfemale_06226| You are not inferior, but you are a jackal and behave like your species. 
train_hindifullfemale_06227| Many years ago, I took pity on you and raised you among my cubs as my own son. 
train_hindifullfemale_06228| But, now that you talk of revenge, I must ask you to leave. 
train_hindifullfemale_06229| The lioness roared, Go away, and do not return again, or I shall kill you myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_06230| Return to your clan where you belong. 
train_hindifullfemale_06231| When the jackal heard this, he fled immediately to find his own clan and live among them. 
train_hindifullfemale_06232| The wise indeed say, Know the truth about yourself and act accordingly. 
train_hindifullfemale_06233| Ujjwalaka was a cart-maker, who was very poor due to lack of orders for cart-making. 
train_hindifullfemale_06234| One day, he was fed up with his poor condition, and thought, I languish in this poverty, when all other people have some work or the other that pays them. 
train_hindifullfemale_06235| I don't have a proper home, or proper clothing, or proper food. 
train_hindifullfemale_06236| There is no point in staying here, I shall go somewhere else to seek success. 
train_hindifullfemale_06237| Thus, the cart-maker took his family and left the town. 
train_hindifullfemale_06238| As he was going through the jungle, he saw a female camel in pain. 
train_hindifullfemale_06239| He noticed that the female camel was left behind by a caravan due to her labour pains. 
train_hindifullfemale_06240| He gave her water, and grass and she recovered. 
train_hindifullfemale_06241| She also gave birth to a baby camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_06242| Next morning, he took the camel and the baby camel under his patronage, and took them to his home. 
train_hindifullfemale_06243| This became the new home for the camels. 
train_hindifullfemale_06244| The camels were very happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06245| Over time, the baby camel grew taller, and the cart-maker lovingly tied a bell around the young camel's neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_06246| He started selling the female camel's milk, and the earnings were enough for him to support his family. He realized that this business was profitable, and he did not require to seek any job. 
train_hindifullfemale_06247| One day, he said to his wife, I can support the family by selling the milk of one camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_06248| This profession is too easy, and yet profitable. 
train_hindifullfemale_06249| I shall borrow some money from a wealthy merchant and buy another camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_06250| During the time that I am gone, please take proper care of the camels. 
train_hindifullfemale_06251| His wife agreed with him, and he started the journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_06252| After a few days, he returned with a young camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_06253| He was fortunate, and within a few years he owned many camels. 
train_hindifullfemale_06254| He even employed a servant to take proper care of the camels. 
train_hindifullfemale_06255| He would reward the servant one baby camel every year. 
train_hindifullfemale_06256| Thus, the cart-maker became rich, and led a happy life. 
train_hindifullfemale_06257| He took care of the camels, and the younger ones, but his favourite camel was the baby camel who wore a bell around his neck. 
train_hindifullfemale_06258| The jingling sound she made, made the cart-maker very happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06259| Every afternoon, the camels would graze in the nearby jungle, and eat tender grass. 
train_hindifullfemale_06260| They would also drink water from a big lake, and bath and play games there. 
train_hindifullfemale_06261| They would return before sunset. 
train_hindifullfemale_06262| The young camel that had a bell around his neck always trailed behind the others. 
train_hindifullfemale_06263| Due to this, the other camels always advised him to keep up with them, lest he strayed away and got lost. 
train_hindifullfemale_06264| Despite numerous advice, scoldings, and warnings, he remained conceited, and wandered about on his own. 
train_hindifullfemale_06265| Being their master's favourite, he was proud of himself. 
train_hindifullfemale_06266| One day, as the camels were grazing about, a lion came wandering. 
train_hindifullfemale_06267| He was attracted by the sound of the bell from a distance, and cautiously observed the group of camels. 
train_hindifullfemale_06268| As he waited for an opportune moment, he noticed a young camel with a bell around his neck trailing behind and straying away from the group. 
train_hindifullfemale_06269| The lion followed him, and overtook the camel. 
train_hindifullfemale_06270| Before the camel could raise his voice to alert the others, the lion jumped on him and killed him instantly. 
train_hindifullfemale_06271| The wise indeed say, A foolish person who refuses to follow a good advice surely comes to grief. 
train_hindifullfemale_06272| There was a wild jackal called Mahachaturaka, who lived in a jungle. 
train_hindifullfemale_06273| One day, as he was wandering about in the jungle in search of food, he saw a dead elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_06274| He knew that the dead elephant would provide him food for many days. 
train_hindifullfemale_06275| But his happiness soon turned into frustration, as he was not able to tear the elephant's thick skin. 
train_hindifullfemale_06276| He went round and round, trying his luck from all side, but in vain. 
train_hindifullfemale_06277| As he was still trying to figure it out, the jackal saw a lion approaching. 
train_hindifullfemale_06278| He quickly bowed, and said, O King of jungle, I found this dead elephant and was keeping a watch over it so that you could have it. 
train_hindifullfemale_06279| Please be kind to eat to your heart's content. 
train_hindifullfemale_06280| But the lion refused, I eat a prey only when I hunt it myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_06281| That is my nature. 
train_hindifullfemale_06282| Thank you for your offer, but you can have the elephant for yourself 
train_hindifullfemale_06283| The lion departed after being thanked by the jackal. 
train_hindifullfemale_06284| But his problem remained. 
train_hindifullfemale_06285| He wondered how he could tear apart the elephant's thick skin. 
train_hindifullfemale_06286| At the very moment he saw a leopard approaching. 
train_hindifullfemale_06287| He thought, I got rid of the lion by being humble, but I have to be cunning in order to get rid of him! 
train_hindifullfemale_06288| At once the jackal climbed on top of the elephant and raised his shoulders proudly. 
train_hindifullfemale_06289| He said to the leopard, O Uncle, You have come here to the very jaws of death! 
train_hindifullfemale_06290| This elephant was hunted by the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_06291| He asked me to guard it and call for him if anybody was to approach it. 
train_hindifullfemale_06292| The leopard noticed the lions tracks nearby, and believed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06293| He began to tremble in fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_06294| He pleaded, O Nephew, Please do not tell the lion I was here. 
train_hindifullfemale_06295| I must leave and look for food elsewhere. 
train_hindifullfemale_06296| With this, the leopard ran away, after assuring the jackal not to tell the lion that he was here. 
train_hindifullfemale_06297| Now, he saw a tiger approaching. 
train_hindifullfemale_06298| He thought, I fooled the leopard, but the tiger is not a fool. 
train_hindifullfemale_06299| Besides, he has sharp teeth. 
train_hindifullfemale_06300| If I can have him tear the elephant's skin, I can finally eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_06301| He shouted to the tiger, Hey Tiger, It is a long time since I have seen you. 
train_hindifullfemale_06302| You look thin and starved. 
train_hindifullfemale_06303| Be my guest, You can eat this elephant while I keep a watch for the lion. 
train_hindifullfemale_06304| He killed the elephant and asked me to look after it till he returned. 
train_hindifullfemale_06305| Eat, and don't worry, I'll keep a watch. 
train_hindifullfemale_06306| The tiger was convinced by the jackal, and delighted. 
train_hindifullfemale_06307| He at once jumped and tore apart a big chunk of the elephant's skin. 
train_hindifullfemale_06308| Just as he started eating, the jackal jumped, Here comes the lion, quick! Hide or run away. 
train_hindifullfemale_06309| The tiger ran away as fast as possible. 
train_hindifullfemale_06310| The jackal was finally ready to eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_06311| The tiger had provided him the opening that he needed. 
train_hindifullfemale_06312| Just as he was about to eat, another jackal arrived. 
train_hindifullfemale_06313| He fought with the other jackal bravely, and chased him away. 
train_hindifullfemale_06314| Thus, he was finally able to eat the elephant. 
train_hindifullfemale_06315| The wise indeed say, Bow before the mighty, throw something before the low and fight the equally powerful. 
train_hindifullfemale_06316| Chitranga was a dog, who lived in a certain town which was affected by a famine. 
train_hindifullfemale_06317| People had no food to eat, and they cared not to give any to the dogs or cattle or any animal. 
train_hindifullfemale_06318| Due to lack of food, along with other animals, the dogs were starving. 
train_hindifullfemale_06319| Some of them even died. 
train_hindifullfemale_06320| Chitranga was not able to bear the hunger and realizing that the place did not offer conditions to live, he decided to leave for a foreign land in search of food and better conditions. 
train_hindifullfemale_06321| After travelling a long distance, he came to a certain town. 
train_hindifullfemale_06322| He saw a door open in one of the houses due to the negligence of a rich lady householder. 
train_hindifullfemale_06323| He went into the house, and found abundant food. 
train_hindifullfemale_06324| He had not eaten for a long time, and ate to his heart's content. 
train_hindifullfemale_06325| Then he thought of leaving silently. 
train_hindifullfemale_06326| No sooner had he come out of the house, he was spotted by other dogs of the neighbourhood. 
train_hindifullfemale_06327| They realized he did not belong to their community and chased him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06328| Since he had his stomach full, he could not run fast, and they bit him all over with their sharp teeth. 
train_hindifullfemale_06329| He somehow escaped, and thought, It is better to live in peace in one's own country, be it affected by famine. 
train_hindifullfemale_06330| When he returned to his country, the starving dogs there were curious. 
train_hindifullfemale_06331| His friends and relatives gathered around him to enquire about his findings, Please tell us about the foreign country you visited. 
train_hindifullfemale_06332| How is it like? How are the people? Is there plenty of food? 
train_hindifullfemale_06333| The dog said, O friends and relatives, What can I say? 
train_hindifullfemale_06334| In the foreign country, the women are careless. 
train_hindifullfemale_06335| They leave doors and windows open. 
train_hindifullfemale_06336| There is lots of food to eat. 
train_hindifullfemale_06337| But, your own kith and kin will not show any sympathy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06338| They will torment you to death. 
train_hindifullfemale_06339| The wise indeed say, The outsiders may tolerate your lapses but not your own kith and kin. 
train_hindifullfemale_06340| Dev Sharma was a Brahmin who used to live with his wife in a certain town. 
train_hindifullfemale_06341| One day, his wife gave birth to a son and they were very happy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06342| On the very same day, a female mongoose gave birth to a baby mongoose very near his house. 
train_hindifullfemale_06343| As destiny would have it, the mother mongoose died soon after the birth. 
train_hindifullfemale_06344| When they observed this, they took pity on him and the Brahmin's wife adopted the little mongoose and started looking after him as her own son. 
train_hindifullfemale_06345| She served her own breast milk to both her own son and the little mongoose, bathed them together and put oil on them together. 
train_hindifullfemale_06346| She was a fond mother for both of them. 
train_hindifullfemale_06347| Both her son and the mongoose were very fond of each other, and spent all the time together. 
train_hindifullfemale_06348| However, she was not a fool and knowing that the mongoose was an animal in reality, she always kept a guard. 
train_hindifullfemale_06349| He is a mongoose and will soon develop the animal instincts that he has inherited from his species. 
train_hindifullfemale_06350| Some day, he may harm my own son. 
train_hindifullfemale_06351| I shall always keep a watch on him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06352| One day, she had to fetch some water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06353| So, she put her son to bed, and while going outside with the pitcher, asked her husband to keep a watch. 
train_hindifullfemale_06354| She said, I am going to the well to fetch some water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06355| Please look after our son and make sure the mongoose does not hurt him by mistake. 
train_hindifullfemale_06356| The Brahmin was careless. 
train_hindifullfemale_06357| Without informing his wife, he got prepared and went to beg for alms leaving the little mongoose and their son alone by themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_06358| As it happened, during the very time they were alone, a poisonous snake entered the house through a hole and started approaching the Brahmin's son. 
train_hindifullfemale_06359| When the mongoose saw this, he attacked his natural enemy to defend the child, who was like a brother to him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06360| Although he was small and the snake was strong, he fought with all his might and bit the snake into pieces and eventually killed the snake. 
train_hindifullfemale_06361| His mouth and claws were all smeared with the snake's blood. 
train_hindifullfemale_06362| The little mongoose was very proud of itself, and waited outside the house for the Brahmin's wife. 
train_hindifullfemale_06363| He was eager to show his mother how brave he was. 
train_hindifullfemale_06364| Knowing her husband's carelessness, the Brahmin's wife was tensed and was returning in a hurry when she saw the little mongoose coming towards her. 
train_hindifullfemale_06365| She noticed that he was covered in blood, and without thinking, jumped to the conclusion that the mongoose must have attacked her son. 
train_hindifullfemale_06366| Angered and frustrated, she threw the heavy pitcher full of water, she was carrying on the little mongoose. 
train_hindifullfemale_06367| The little mongoose was severely wounded. 
train_hindifullfemale_06368| She ran inside, and she was amazed to see her son safely sleeping in his cradle. 
train_hindifullfemale_06369| She then saw the snake near the cradle that had been torn to shreds. 
train_hindifullfemale_06370| At once she realized what had happened. 
train_hindifullfemale_06371| She was heart-broken with the thought of having hurt the little mongoose, who was like a son to her. 
train_hindifullfemale_06372| Not knowing who to blame, when her husband returned home, she explained, and they were both very sorry for the suffering of their second son. 
train_hindifullfemale_06373| The wise indeed say, Think hard and do not do anything in haste. 
train_hindifullfemale_06374| Four Brahmins lived in a certain town, who shared a good friendship among themselves. 
train_hindifullfemale_06375| However, they were utterly poor. 
train_hindifullfemale_06376| They discussed their condition and concluded, Let us leave this place, where we are languishing in poverty. 
train_hindifullfemale_06377| Let us go somewhere else and prosper. 
train_hindifullfemale_06378| After meeting their friends and relatives, they started on their travels. 
train_hindifullfemale_06379| After some time, they reached a town, where they decided to stay for some time. 
train_hindifullfemale_06380| There was a Shiva's temple nearby on the bank of a river. 
train_hindifullfemale_06381| They worshiped in this temple after bathing in the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_06382| It was there, that they met a Yogi, and accompanied him to his hermitage. 
train_hindifullfemale_06383| The Yogi enquired, Who are you? And where do you come from? 
train_hindifullfemale_06384| They explained their condition to the Yogi. 
train_hindifullfemale_06385| We took this journey to earn money. 
train_hindifullfemale_06386| We were in a state of poverty, and would have died in our town. 
train_hindifullfemale_06387| Since you are an accomplished Yogi, we believe you must be gifted with wonderful powers. 
train_hindifullfemale_06388| Please guide us to the path of earning money. 
train_hindifullfemale_06389| They continued, We dedicate ourselves to you, and are ready to undertake whatever path you guide us to. 
train_hindifullfemale_06390| On observing their pitiable condition, the Yogi agreed. 
train_hindifullfemale_06391| He took out four cotton wicks, and gave each of them a wick. 
train_hindifullfemale_06392| He said, With the wick in your hand, take the path that takes you to the Himalayas. 
train_hindifullfemale_06393| Keep walking till one of you accidentally drops his wick. 
train_hindifullfemale_06394| The location where the wick drops accidentally would be the location you would find hidden treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_06395| Dig it out, and return home with the collected treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_06396| The four Brahmins took his blessings, and started their journey towards the Himalayas. 
train_hindifullfemale_06397| They travelled for days, when one of them dropped his wick accidentally. 
train_hindifullfemale_06398| He dug the place where the cotton wick had fallen, and uncovered a treasure filled with copper. 
train_hindifullfemale_06399| He asked his friends, Come on! There is too much treasure for even four of us to carry. 
train_hindifullfemale_06400| Let us collect, and go home. 
train_hindifullfemale_06401| We are now rich, You need not go any further! 
train_hindifullfemale_06402| The other three discussed and said, You were destined to this copper treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_06403| We may be destined to richer treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_06404| You may collect all the copper you can and return home. 
train_hindifullfemale_06405| We will continue with our journey. 
train_hindifullfemale_06406| Thus, the Brahmin collected his treasure and started travelling homewards, while the rest of the Brahmins continued their journey with their wicks in their hands. 
train_hindifullfemale_06407| They travelled for few more days, when one of them dropped his wick accidentally. 
train_hindifullfemale_06408| He dug the place where the cotton wick had fallen, and uncovered a treasure filled with silver. 
train_hindifullfemale_06409| The other two discussed and said, You were destined to this silver treasure. 
train_hindifullfemale_06410| After a few more days of travelling, one of them dropped his wick accidentally. 
train_hindifullfemale_06411| He dug the place where the cotton wick had fallen, and uncovered a treasure filled with gold. 
train_hindifullfemale_06412| The fourth Brahmin replied, Stupid! You don't understand what is happening. 
train_hindifullfemale_06413| First copper, then silver, now it is gold! 
train_hindifullfemale_06414| You all were destined to these treasures. 
train_hindifullfemale_06415| Next time, I am sure I'll find a richer treasure of diamonds and pearls. 
train_hindifullfemale_06416| I will stay here and guard this treasure of gold, and we will return home together after you return. 
train_hindifullfemale_06417| Thus, the fourth Brahmin continued his journey with his wick in his hand. 
train_hindifullfemale_06418| After travelling alone for a few more days, he felt tired. 
train_hindifullfemale_06419| He was suffering from the tremendous heat and got very thirsty. 
train_hindifullfemale_06420| Soon, he lost his way, and started travelling in circles. 
train_hindifullfemale_06421| Trying to figure out the right direction, he came across a man with a whirling wheel around his head. 
train_hindifullfemale_06422| His body was smeared with blood. 
train_hindifullfemale_06423| The fourth Brahmin was so thirsty, that instead of helping the man, he asked, Please tell me where I can get some water. 
train_hindifullfemale_06424| Whoever you are, with a wheel around your head, Please tell me quickly 
train_hindifullfemale_06425| No sooner had he uttered these words, the wheel shifted from the other man to this fourth Brahmin. 
train_hindifullfemale_06426| It began whirling around the fourth Brahmin's head; and it pained beyond endurance. 
train_hindifullfemale_06427| He cried, What is the meaning of this? 
train_hindifullfemale_06428| Why has the wheel attached itself to my head? 
train_hindifullfemale_06429| Please tell me how I can get rid of this. 
train_hindifullfemale_06430| The man relieved from the wheel replied, When someone carrying a magical cotton wick is to come here, and speaks to you. 
train_hindifullfemale_06431| Once upon a time, In a river far away, Lived three little fishes, Who loved to swim and play. Far and near they swam, In and out they dived, Up and down they splashed, Morning, noon, and night. 
train_hindifullfemale_06432| I am Karadi the bear. I would like to tell you the story of these three fishes, who were called, Timsi, Bucki and Moti. The three fishes were good friends, and lived happlily, in the river. 
train_hindifullfemale_06433| The wisest of the three friends, is Timsi. Golden like the sunset, she has strong fins, and a wise mind. Can you see her in the picture. Let's hear what she has to say. 
train_hindifullfemale_06434| My name is Timsi Machli, I like to be on time, I finish all my work, Well ahead of time. I am neat and clean and tidy. A mess, I do not like. I always wake up early, And go to bed at nine. 
train_hindifullfemale_06435| The blue fish that's swimming behind Timsi, is Bucki. Bucki was not as wise as Timsi, but he was smart. He always did things, at the last moment, but just in time. 
train_hindifullfemale_06436| Hello! Hello! Bucki Macch is my name, If there's work that must be done, I do it all the same. There's always enough time, Why plan and worry. I'll do it sometime later. What's the big hurry. 
train_hindifullfemale_06437| The third of the three friends is Moti. Big and red, Moti is fat and lazy. He doesn't even like to flap his fins to swim. Most of the time he just floats! 
train_hindifullfemale_06438| My name is Moti Meen, But Motu I am called, I love to eat and sleep, And not work at all. Timsi and dear Bucki Say I am very lazy; But me and work together? They must be crazy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06439| Timsi, Bucki and Moti were good griends, and though they had different ways of doing things, they were always together. 
train_hindifullfemale_06440| One day, Timsi decided to go to visit her cousin. As she left, she called her friends and told them: Now listen to me, you two: Be careful when I go; Stay close to this rock, And swimvery low. I'll be back very soon, So wait over here; This place is very safe, You have nothing to fear. 
train_hindifullfemale_06441| Bucki and Moti wiggled their tails. And in fish language it means two things- OK and good – bye! 
train_hindifullfemale_06442| Timsi swam away swiftly. Immediately, Moti went to sleep behind the big rock, while Bucki decided to improve his arithmetic. He began counting the little fish that swam past them. And when bigger fish came, Bucki hid behind the rock. 
train_hindifullfemale_06443| One fish, two fish, three fish four; five, six, seven fish, There come more! Moti awoke from his nap and joined Bucki in counting. Eight fish swimming, Nine fish green; Ten looks big, Is she a queen? Hello! Yellow eleven! I'm Bucki, the blue! Counting is such fun, Can you do it too? 
train_hindifullfemale_06444| Soon Timsi returned. She was very worried. Oh! Listen, my friends, The news is not good, Fishermen are coming, Swim away, we should! If we don't leave quickly, On one thing I can bet, They'ii surely catch us all In their huge, big net. 
train_hindifullfemale_06445| Bucki and Moti did not believe Tisi. Bucki though, If the fishermen come tomorrow, then I'll think of a way. Why should I leave my house now? Moti was too lazy to even think. He did not want to go anywhere or do anything. 
train_hindifullfemale_06446| Our parents lived here, And our grandfathers three. Leave our home? Never! Cried Bucki and Moti. We won't ever leave This cool and lovely river. We don't believe you! Come with you? Never! 
train_hindifullfemale_06447| Timsi tried to make her two foolish friends understand the danger. But they did not want to listen to her. So, feeling very sad, she decided to leave her friends. 
train_hindifullfemale_06448| The next morning, as Bucki and Moti swam from their home, they saw the fishermen. Timsi was right. There was danger! The morning, the fisherman, When his net did cast, First Bucki was caught, But he acted real fast. Bucki held his breath And threw back his head. He turned on his back And acted as if dead. 
train_hindifullfemale_06449| The fisherman thought that he had caught a deadfish. I'll throw him out. Who wants a dead fish? he said. Hid eyes fell on Moti. I'll get that red, fat one, he said. He threw his net and Moti was caught! 
train_hindifullfemale_06450| Moti wept and cried. He was caught in the snare, He didn't know what to do, He was so very scared. He wiggled his tail; Even his fins he flapped, But nothing could he do! In the net he was trapped! 
train_hindifullfemale_06451| Oh, save me, oh, help me! Moti cried in fear; Bucki heard his call, Though he was not very near. 
train_hindifullfemale_06452| Just as Bucki was wondering what to do to save his friend, Timsi arrived. On seeing her, Bucki cried, Timsi, oh Timsi, Moti is caught! I wish we had listened To the words you taught! 
train_hindifullfemale_06453| Timsi thought for a moment. She quickly whispered something into Bucki's ear. Then they swam to where Moti was caught. 
train_hindifullfemale_06454| Both Timsi and Bucki Dived from very high, The water splashed up Into the fisherman's eye. The water stung the fisherman's eye. His hands dropped the net. Hurry, Moti! The net is loose! Jump! Timsi shouted. Moti pushed through the net with his snout, and out he jumped. Quickly, the three friends dived into the deep. The puzzled fisherman who did not even catch a single fish rowed away scratching his head. 
train_hindifullfemale_06455| Timsi, Bucki and moti were happy that they were together once again. Bucki and Moti promised Timsi that they would do their work on time and not be lazy. They had learnt their lesson. 
train_hindifullfemale_06456| Welcome to my jungle, the stories I will share Of antelopes and alligators, jackals here and there. I'll tell you about monkeys, lion fierce and strong, Crows and owls and other birds, reptiles short and long. I'll tell you about enemies, of greed and jealousy, I'll tell you about friendship, love and harmony. From all these tales we'll discover, through all our jungle friends, The wit and ageless wisdom, the advice that they lend. This is the story of The Blue Jackal. You can read along with Karadi the bear. Youwill know it is time to turn the page when you hear his cane tap like this. Let us begin now. 
train_hindifullfemale_06457| It is a full moon night. The jackals are howling again. It is the second time that I have been disturbed from my hibernating sleep. I am Karadi, the bear. I do not like being aroused from my six-month sleep. I stroll out of my cave to look around. The night sky is bright with the full moon. At a distance I see the silhouettes of the jackals and hyenas. Their raised faces are howling at the moon. I feel a chill wind blow and I hurry back into my cave. The howling continues and I cannot sleep. I remember Chandarva. Have you ever seen a blue jackal. Well, neither had I, until I met chandarva. 
train_hindifullfemale_06458| Many full moons ago, there lived in this jungle, a jackal called Chandarva. He was a good-looking fellow with gleaming golden fur and a bushy tail. He had a sharp piercing howl of which he was very proud. However, Chandarva was tinier than most other jackals his age and was therefore teased and bullied by the others in his pack. 
train_hindifullfemale_06459| I wish they would leave me alone, he thought unhappily. One particular day Chandarva was especially unhappy because he had not eaten anything.The precious day a zebra had been killed. All the other jackals had eaten to their stomach's fill. But Chandarva had been shoved and pushed and not allowed to come near the dead zebra. Finally, he had been left only the bones to lick. He was angry, hungry and unhappy. 
train_hindifullfemale_06460| It is becoming more and more difficult to get anything to eat these days. I have to get away from these jackals. At this rate, they are going to starve me to death. What shall I do? 
train_hindifullfemale_06461| On the outskirts of the jungle was a village. Chandarva during his roaming through the jungle had often heard the sounds of goats bleating, hens clucking and cocks crowing. Many times he dreamt of feasting himself on the plump hens but the sight of the villagers with huge sticks scared him. But today he was desperate. 
train_hindifullfemale_06462| I have to eat something. I will wait until it is dark. When all the village is asleep, I will sneak in and help myself to a few hens. With this plan in mind, Chandarva seated himself under a tree at the edge of the jungle. From there, he could get clear view of the village yet not be noticed. 
train_hindifullfemale_06463| Night fell. Everything was quiet. Only the song of the crickets disturbed the silence of the night. All were asleep. Chandarva rose from where he was seated and looked around. The village was still. Not a soul seemed to stir. With his heart in his mouth, Chandarva slowly entered the village. He sniffed around. He did not know where the chickens and hens were kept. That did not worry him. His nose would lead the way. 
train_hindifullfemale_06464| The scent was getting stronger. He quickened his steps. Suddenly his sharp cars perked. Was that a growl he heard? He looked behind. At the end of the street, he noticed the dog. It was huge. Its bright eyes gleamed in the dark. And from its throat came a fierce rumble. Behind this huge mongrel, were two others, and they were all coming towards him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06465| Fear crept over Chandarva. He started to run. He could hear the dogs coming after him. Their growls had turned into barks. Chandarva ran as fast as he could. Suddenly he stopped. Ahead of him were two other dogs. On seeing him, they snarled and snapped their teeth at him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06466| Chandrava turned and ran. His head reeled. The street dogs were coming at him from all sides. With the dogs following him, Chandarva dashed from one street to another. Terrified, he ran into a house. It was dark inside. The sound of the approaching dogs threw Chandarva into a panic. Looking for a place to hide, he stumbled and fell into a huge vessel. 
train_hindifullfemale_06467| Now the house that Chandarva had entered belonged to the village dyer. The dyer kept all his dyes in big vessels. The dyes were of several colours- green, yellow, red, purple, indigo. Chandarva had fallen into the indigo dye. Having fallen into this dark blue coloured dye, for that is the colour of indigo, Chandarva stayed there until the sound of the dogs could be heard no more. 
train_hindifullfemale_06468| Just at the break of dawn, poor Chandarva who had almost fallen asleep in the indigo dye, clambered out of the vessel and ran back into the jungle. As he reached the jungle, all the other animals that lived there, looked at him strangely and with fear in their eyes. Many ran away as he came nearer. 
train_hindifullfemale_06469| What is that strange coloured animal which has entered our jungle? whispered the frightened gazelles to each other. What kind of creature is this? We have never before seen such an odd animal. Looks a little like a jackal, yet that strange, frightening 
train_hindifullfemale_06470| colour? Oh no! It cannot be one of us, though the jackals. I wonder how strong this creature is, though the lion. I wonder how clever he is, though the monkey. 
train_hindifullfemale_06471| Glancing at himself, Chandarva saw the brilliant blue colour his golden fur had turned to. With the first rays of the sun falling on him, his skin glowed even brighter. Good heavens! I look horrible. No wonder the animals are so frightened of me. If I didn't know better, I would be frightened of myself. But wait! What a golden opportunity! 
train_hindifullfemale_06472| Thinking this, he called out, Hey there, you wild creatures! Why are you all running from me? Let me tell you who I am. I am your new King. God has sent me to rule over you. I come from the heavens, therefore my blue colour. From now, I shall be your lord and protector. Come back. Live happily under me. 
train_hindifullfemale_06473| Hearing this mighty speech, the entire gathering of wild creatures came forward. Lions, tigers, monkeys, gazelles, giraffes and also the jackals. They bowed low to Chandarva, touched his feet and said, O Lord, O Master, we salute you. We've never seen anyone quite so blue. O King, O Monarch, O Badshah, We kneel, we bow to you, O Raja, We'll sing for you, we'll dance with you, We'll bring you food to suit your every mood. We'll make you happy, we'll make you glad. We'll cheer you up whenever you are sad. 
train_hindifullfemale_06474| Chandarva laughed to himself. Oh, this is fun! Hewho had been teased and bullied was now wearing the mantle of a king, and all because of his blue fur. Who could have dreamt of this? Aloud he said, Mr.Lion, you shall be my Chief Minister. You will hunt and bring me food everyday. Mr. Tiger, you will assist Mr. Lion. Mr. Elephant, you are my royal doorkeeper and Mr. Monkey, you have the special honour of holding the royal umbrella over me. 
train_hindifullfemale_06475| Court dismissed! The jackals who earlier belonged to Chandarva's pack whimpered. They had not been given any duties. Looking at his relatives, Chandarva yelled, Get out of my kingdom. If I lay my eyes on any of you, I will eat you for dinner. Now run before I set my chief minister on you. The frightened jackals ran away and stayed out of Chandarva's sight. 
train_hindifullfemale_06476| Chandarva lived like a king. His blue fur made the other animals stare at him in awe. The lions and tigers hunted and killed and brought him the choicest food. He ate well and forget about the other jackals. Life is wonderful, he sighed. 
train_hindifullfemale_06477| Many such wonderful days passed. One glorious full moon night, after eating a delicious dinner, Chandarva sat talking to the other animals. Suddenly from a distance, a pack of jackals started howling. As soon as he heard this, Chandarva's body thrilled in delight. His eyes filled with tears of joy. Oh how he missed his family! Forgetting where he was and who he was pretending to be, Chandarva also started howling in a shrill high pitched tone. 
train_hindifullfemale_06478| There was a hushed silence from all the other animals. The lion gasped in surprise. The tiger's mouth fell open. Good heavens! This is no blue king from heaven. This is an ordinary jackal! We have been fooled. Let us kill the rogue. 
train_hindifullfemale_06479| Chandarva immersed in his howling suddenly heard angry growls and roars around him. He realised that the animals had discovered who he really was. Well, all good things must come to an end. Let me start running. Tiny that he was, Chandarva could run fast and escape the fury of the other animals. 
train_hindifullfemale_06480| I was told by some monkeys many days later, that when the rains came the blue colour finally washed off and Chandarva had his golden fur again. He joined his pack of jackal relatives and whenever the moon was full, one could hear him howling loudly and fiercely to his heart's content. 
train_hindifullfemale_06481| Hello Childer, remember me? Your friend, Karadi the bear? Today's story is the story of kauaa and Lomdi. Kauaa is a crow and Lomdi is a fox. A fox, like his cousin the jackal, is very cunning. Let's see how cunning Lomdi fooled Kauaa. 
train_hindifullfemale_06482| Mrs.Kauaa, the crow Lived on a tree. Happy she was Wild and free. From her nest every morning Flew Kauaa far and wide. Sometimes just for fun, At times for food to find. From neem tree to mango Kauaa loved to fly; Sometimes she just soared In the bright blue sky! 
train_hindifullfemale_06483| On a fine April morning After flying a lot, Kauaa sat near a house Feeling hungry and hot. She looked left and right, And up and down too, Hoping she would find Some rice, a fruit or two. Lucky was she, For some roti she saw Being made by a granny On a sunny verandah . Ah! Roti is my favourite And it's almost lunch time; I'll swoop down and get it And eat it with some lime. 
train_hindifullfemale_06484| So Kauaa glided down like a plane, picked a roti from the granny's vessel and quickly flew towards her nest on the old tamarind tree. With the roti in her beak Kauaa sat down to eat, When suddenly she heard The sound of someone's feet. Is it a dog or a cat, Or a bear, big and brown. Who can this be? Thought Kauaa with a frown. 
train_hindifullfemale_06485| From under the bushes She saw something come out. It was Lomdi, the fox, With his long, red snout. Now, Lomdi, the wily Had smelt the roti too, His mouth began to water And his hunger grew. Lomdi looked up and saw that Kauaa had the roti in her beak.His sharp mind began to think, A bird I'm not, So I cannot swoop or fly; But to get the roti Something clever I must try. 
train_hindifullfemale_06486| Lomdi looked at Kauaa. Such ordinary black andgrey feathers. So plain compared to the parrot or the peacock. And when Lomdi though of Kauaa's voice, he shuddered. How often had Kauaa's harsh cawing disturbed his sleep. But now, this plain bird sat on the treetop with the roti in her beak. How was he to get it? 
train_hindifullfemale_06487| Lomdi was always full of ideas and tricks. He looked up at Kauaa with a sweet smile and said, Good morning, oh Kauaa! The best of all crows! I've heard so much about you, Why, the whole jungle knows! Your beauty, dear Kauaa, Puts peacocks to shame; Black feathers, grey neck, `Sundari' should be your name. What a pretty face! And lovely eyes, too! Kauaa, my dear, How can I describe you? 
train_hindifullfemale_06488| On the top of the tree, Kauaa heard her praises. She puffed up her chest and turned her head. She was very proud of her looks. She loved her black feathers and her sharp beak. Hearing Lomdi praise her made her very happy. With the roti in her beak she nodded at him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06489| Lomdi's eyes sparkled. His plan was working. Quickly he continued, And your voice is sweeter Than the koyals, they say, When you sing a song Trees dance and sway. Please, Kauaa, my friend, May I make a request? Sing for me a song, The one you like best. Open your mouth, Let the sweat music flow, Come, Kauaa, sing a song, Whichever you know! 
train_hindifullfemale_06490| Kauaa blushed with pride. She smiled and thought to herself, Sweeter is my song Than the Koyal's ku, ku, ku! Once Lomdi hears it, He'll dance to its tune. So, without thinking, Kauaa closed her eyes and began, Saa, but before she could Sing re ga ma pa, Down from her beak Fell the roti, in Lomdi's paw! 
train_hindifullfemale_06491| Poor Kauaa! Not knowing that the roti had fallen from her beak, she kept on singing. Sa! Sing the sunflowers, Re! ring out the red roses, Ga! giggle the gulmohurs, Ma! murmur the marigolds, Pa! pop the pretty poppies, Da! dance the dahlias, Ni! nod the neem flowers! Sa re ga ma pa da ni sa. 
train_hindifullfemale_06492| When the song ended, she opened her eyes, hopingshe would see Lomdi clapping. But instead, Lomdi was eating the roti that had fallen from her beak and was smacking his lips. Looking at Kauaa, he sang, Kauaa, you silly crow. How could you believe me? You and sing well? Your voice is like the noise Stones in empty vessels make! You and the donkey, Dhondu, A perfect duet would make. 
train_hindifullfemale_06493| So saying, Lomdi ran away. Kauaa flew behind him. But Lomdi hid in the bushes, and Kauaa came back empty-beaked. Hmm! Poor Kauaa! See how she was deceived by flattery? Lomdi had not only taken away kauaa's favourite lunch, he had also made her look foolish. 
train_hindifullfemale_06494| Kauaa flew back to the window of the house where she had found the roti. Lucky for her the granny had left the rotis uncovered on the verandah. Kauaa picked up a roti and flew back to her nest in the old tamarind tree, determined not to be fooled again. 
train_hindifullfemale_06495| It is spring time. The forest is a riot of colours and scents. The flowers burst forth with vivid hues. Their fragrances intoxicate my senses. Roses dance with bobbing heads, jasmines swirl in enticing ways and the bright sunflowers dazzle in the golden sunlight. Ah! Spring is here! My senses are awakened and I am filled with joy. I am Karadi the bear. It feels good to awaken after my long sleep to the song of the koyal and the dance of the peacock. With a song on my lips and a bounce in my step, I leave my cave. 
train_hindifullfemale_06496| Stretch your arms and spread your wings, Spring is here to stay. Sing a song and swirl around, winter's gone away. Sunlight shimmers, dew drops glimmer, The valley echoes with song. The blue brook murmurs, the cool breeze whispers, Come, let's sing along! Sparrows chirping, peacocks dancing, butterflies bounce in glee. Blue-bells bobbing, bees a-buzzing, come and dance with me! Leaves are sprouting, squirrels shuffling, The cuckoo trills in delight Marigolds flaming, roses blushing, Spring, you're a welcome sight. 
train_hindifullfemale_06497| A sudden, harsh sound destroys the enchantment ofthe beautiful spring morning. Goodness gracious! What was that? I hurry in the direction of the discordant sound. 
train_hindifullfemale_06498| Standing in the middle of some newly sprouted grass is my old friend, Dhondu the donkey. With his head raised to the sky, eyes closed, oblivious to his surroundings, Dhondu was braying loudly. Hands over my ears, I yell, Dhondu! Stop that at once! 
train_hindifullfemale_06499| Shaken out of his singing reverie, Dhondu looks at me with hurtful eyes. Oh karadi! Why did you do that? It has been a long time, you Know, since I sang. 
train_hindifullfemale_06500| And aren't we all glad because of that, I think to myself. 
train_hindifullfemale_06501| The song of the koyal was so beautiful, continued Dhondu, I just had to join her, Don't you think we sang a perfect duet? 
train_hindifullfemale_06502| Dhondu, Dhondu, I say irritatedly, Have you forgotten what happened when you sang last year? 
train_hindifullfemale_06503| Embarrassed, Dhondu mumbles, Frankly, I think these humans have no ear for music. What a beautiful moonlight sonata I sang that day! But was there any appreciation? 
train_hindifullfemale_06504| I Chuckle. Moonlight sonata? More like moonlight madness! My mind travels back to that day. Would you like to hear where Dhondu's music took him last year? 
train_hindifullfemale_06505| Dhondu used to work for a washerman who lived in the village just outside the forest. All day long, Dhondu would carry the washerman's load from the village to the river and back again. However, at night, when his work was dome, Dhondu roamed around the village. In his youth, Dhondu must have been a handsome fellow. But age and hard work had caught up with him, and now he was old and lean. The thick grey fur that once covered his body had now grown thin and sparse. His teeth, which could chew even tough leather, had begun to fall. 
train_hindifullfemale_06506| But Dhondu did not care. Uncomplaining, he went about his work. He liked the washerman and enjoyed his work also. But more than anything, Dhondu looked forward to the timewhen he could sing. 
train_hindifullfemale_06507| Hi Dhondu, greeted Juno the jackal, one night. Where shall we go tonight? Juno and Dhondu were good friends. Every night, they would meet outside the village and wander in search of food. 
train_hindifullfemale_06508| You know, Juno, said Dhondu, I heard the washerman tell his wife about a new cucumber patch that has been laid. Shall we go in search of that? It has been ages since I have eaten any cucumbers. 
train_hindifullfemale_06509| Come in then, said Juno. Off went the two in search of the cucumbers. It wasn't long before Juno's sharp nose found the garden where they grew. Dhondu could not believe what he saw.There were cucumbers everywhere. They grew in every shape and size. Fat, juicy cucumbers. Long, tender ones. Small, sweet and crisp and some that were so huge that the creepers bent under their weight. 
train_hindifullfemale_06510| The next morning, dhondu's mind was not on the job. Clothes kept falling off his back and his legs kept leading him to the cucumber garden. Dhondu, where are you going? the washerman screamed. The washerman could not understand what had come over his loyal donkey. Has this fellow grown so old? the washerman wondered. 
train_hindifullfemale_06511| Dhondu, you are going to be thrashed soundly, he threatened, getting impatient with a disobedient Dhondu. Go towards the river quickly or you shall sleep without any supper tonight. 
train_hindifullfemale_06512| When will the day end? When can I get to my cucumbers? dhondu fretted. He smiled to himself. No supper? What did he care! He had a whole field of cucumbers to feast from. 
train_hindifullfemale_06513| Finally, night came and Dhondu ran to the cucumber field. Juno, who came a few minutes later, could not believe the speed at which his friend was gorging the vegetables. Night after night, Dhondu visited the field and ate more cucumbers. 
train_hindifullfemale_06514| You fat, good-for-nothing donkey, scolded thewasherman, who was getting very angry and irritated with Dhondu's new behaviour. Lost his senses, that's what has happened. An old donkey I have on my hands. Dreaming during the day and snoring like thunder at night. Look how fat you have become, dhondu. Lazy donkey! Starve you, yes, starve you, that is what I am going to do! 
train_hindifullfemale_06515| Dhondu did not care. He had his cucumbers. He didn't want the food the washerman fed him. 
train_hindifullfemale_06516| Juno, on the other hand, was sick of cucumbers. The very sight of the vegetables made him want to run away. He could not understand Dhondu's love for the vegetable. But, just to keep him company, Juno would go with him to the garden. 
train_hindifullfemale_06517| One night, Dhondu had eaten to his heart and stomach's content. The field was aglow with the light from the full moon. The stars played hide and seek in the distance, The crickets sang. A great feeling of joy swept over Dhondu. Singing in contentment, he looked up at the full moon. 
train_hindifullfemale_06518| Juno, I feel like singing. Juno panicked. Did this donkey have any brains at all, he wondered. Don't, Dhondu. Please don't. This is not the time. Maybe tomorrow or even better, maybe next week, you can sing. I hear they are auditioning for a new musical. You can sing there. Come let us leave now before someone sees us. 
train_hindifullfemale_06519| Oh, but Juno, this is the perfect time! The night is beautiful. The moon shines in all its splendour. You have to understand that these are very important elements for a musician. It is not often that a singer has the perfect mood. I wish to sing. I have to sing! Dhondu insisted, clearing his throat and getting ready to break into song. 
train_hindifullfemale_06520| Dhondu, please don't, Juno begged. The farmers will hear you and come after us. We are thieves. If they find us, they are sure to beat us to death. And another thing Dhondu, your voice isn't exactly very sweet, you know. 
train_hindifullfemale_06521| Dhondu's pride was hurt. What did Juno know about music? His howl was so sharp that it hurt the ears. I will give hima lesson or two in singing, he thought. Juno, there are certain things about which you are ignorant. I know you envy my beautiful voice and my singing. You don't wish for everyone to gather around and start applauding. But do not fret, my dear friend. I will teach you to sing later. Right now, I have to sing! 
train_hindifullfemale_06522| Dhondu, listen to me, your braying can be heard far and wide, and it isn't a pleasant sound. Listen to me and do not sing, warned Juno again. 
train_hindifullfemale_06523| Dhondu was beginning to get angry, Juno, I am tired of your arguments. Please leave if you wish to. There are others who appreciate my songs. Saying this Dhondu raised his head, cleared his throat and started to sing. 
train_hindifullfemale_06524| Don't say you were not warned, said Juno, leaving. He did not wish to be caught with Dhondu when the villagers came. And Juno was certain that they would. 
train_hindifullfemale_06525| Dhondu began his song: Shining, shimmering beautiful moon, I would like to sing you a tune. White and winsome, way up high, You're the prettiest in the sky! Have you seen my cucumbers dear? They're so tasty, haven't you heard? I could eat them all day long. Won't you come and dine along? 
train_hindifullfemale_06526| Dhondu's song awoke not just the villagers, but the forest animals as well. Sticks in their hands, the villagers rushed to the cucumber garden. Blissfully unaware of the riot he was causing, Dhondu continued his full-throated braying. Opening his eyes, Dhondu saw the villagers. A smile lit his face. Ah! There they were, his admirers! With renewed vigour, Dhondu sang more loudly. 
train_hindifullfemale_06527| It was unbearable. The villagers thought their eardrums would burst. Dhondu, stop that noise, you stupid donkey! At once! the washerman shouted. Dhondu felt a blow on his back. Surrounding him were the villagers with sticks in their hands. A few had begun to beat him. Stop that horrible sound, you stupid donkey! one of the villagers barked. Dhondu's back hurt. Stop, you tone-deaf creature! No ear for music! 
train_hindifullfemale_06528| Dhondu's pleas were drowned by the villagers' shouts and yells. He was beaten black and blue. Then they dragged him out of the cucumber garden and left him there. Juno, waiting outside in hiding, licked Dhondu's wounds, feeling very sorry for his friend. 
train_hindifullfemale_06529| Dhondu, my friend, I said to him before he could continue his braying this wonderful spring morning, Remember the cucumbers? And, smiling sheepishly, Dhondu stopped. 
train_hindifullfemale_06530| It's night time in the forest. See the white moon peeping? It's quiet and peaceful; Baby animals are sleeping. Sh! Listen! Come here! Can you hear them sing? It's the jackals, and their song Is o Bhuro, the jungle king. 
train_hindifullfemale_06531| Bhuro, Bhuro, we wonder where you are! Bhuro, Bhuro, we wonder how you are! Bhuro, Bhuro, have you seen Juno? Or talked to his cave, O foolish Bhuro? 
train_hindifullfemale_06532| Hello! My name is Karadi and I'm a bear. Did you like the song of the jackals? You know, every time I hear it, I smile to myself. Come, listen to this story of the Talking Cave, and you will know why the jackals sing this song. 
train_hindifullfemale_06533| In the deep green jungle, Where bamboos green grow, Where green parrots play, Lived lion king Bhuro. There are elephants and tigers, And black bears too And they all live together, By the big river blue. Big and strong, Bhuro Was golden in colour; Loud was his roar, But he wasn't too clever! 
train_hindifullfemale_06534| On a warm and lazy afternoon, As the breeze softly blew, Behind silver clouds The sun was napping too. In a den near the tick bushes, Bhuro the lion had just woken from his nap. He yawned and stretched. I'm hungry and am also very thirsty, he growled. What shall I do? What shall I eat? I don't want to hunt In this afternoon heat! But eat I must, For my stomach growls so; Yes! To the cool riverside, That's where I'll go! A grazing deer, Or a rabbit's family Will surely come my way, And fill my tummy. So he went to the river, But no one was there; No deer, no bison, Not even a hare! 
train_hindifullfemale_06535| Red ruby gulmohurs Sparkled in the sun; Golden yellow mangoes Tossed in fun. Bhuro drank some water from the river. Feeling a little better, he crouched in the shade of a big peepal tree. He hoped that some animal would come to the riverside and he could pounce on it. As he sat waiting, his eyes fell upon a large black hole. 
train_hindifullfemale_06536| Aah! What is that hole Near the big banyan tree? It looks like a cave, Whose home could that be? Is it a fox, a wolf, A bear, or just a mouse? I wonder who lives there, In that deep and dark house. 
train_hindifullfemale_06537| Now let me tell you What big Bhuro did. Behind a thin coconut tree, So quietly he hid. He waited and he waited, And still saw no one; The sky turned pink, As home went the sun. He thought and he thought, Then began to grin; Why, whoever went out Must surely come in! Hide in the cave, That's what I'll do! A goat I may catch, And a baby bear too! 
train_hindifullfemale_06538| So he went to the cave, And peeped through the door, Yoo Hoo! Anyone in ? He asked with a roar. There was no answer from the cave. So Bhuro walked right in and hid there. Now the cave that Bhuro was hiding in belonged to Juno, the jackal. When Juno, the Jackal That evening came back, The footprints he saw Made him stop in his tracks. Someone's in my home! Who can it be? Is it a guest or a thief? Wondered Juno worriedly. 
train_hindifullfemale_06539| Juno was a clever fellow. He knew it was not safe to enter his cave. He had to find out who was hiding in it. Suddenly Juno had an idea. He started talking to the cave. Hello, friend cave! How was your day? Were you lonely and sad, While I was away? Juno waited for a few minutes, expecting a reply from the cave. Inside, Bhuro scratched his head. What a strange animal! he thought. Talking to his cave! Just as he was wondering what to do, he heard Juno's voice again. 
train_hindifullfemale_06540| Cave, sweet cave, Won't you greet me today? Though I have come so late, Please don't turn me away! Inside, Bhuro thought, Maybe this is a magical cave which always greets its master. It is quiet today. Maybe it is trying to warn the jackal that I am hiding here. I wonder what I should do? As he wasthinking, outside, Juno asked again, Cave, dear cave, Won't you answer, my dear? For if you don't talk, I'll never return here. 
train_hindifullfemale_06541| Now Bhuro got frightened. If this cave did not answer, the jackal would go away, and Bhuro would have to go to bed hungry. So pretending to be the cave, he said, Good evening, my friend! Hello and hi! Roared foolish Bhuro As if in reply. Welcome! Welcome! My door is open wide! Come rest your weary feet, It is nice and cool inside! Juno knew it was Bhuro hiding in his cave. He laughed loudly and said, Oh! Foolish Bhuro! I know it is you! How could you think A cave could talk too? Feeling very foolish, Bhuro let out an angry roar. And Juno, the jackal Who was very clever, Hearing Bhuro's roar Ran faster than ever. Bhuro, of course, went to bed hungry that day. And I am sure we'll never see him talking to a cave again!
